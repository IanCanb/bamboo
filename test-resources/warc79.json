Soon, it will be time to knock off, crack open a bottle of wine and begin erasing memories of the week that was. Personally, I will be trying to get back the hour I spent watching Kevin Rudd\u0027s glued-on grin and listening to Tony Abbott\u0027s fake laugh. Aren\u0027t we glad that\u0027s over?\nThe debate dominated the news but big ideas on health still seem to be missing in action. So try this one on for size: the economy is making us fat.\nA study by Xin Xu and Robert Kaestner from the University of Illinois examined how the business cycle - the swings in the economy from expansion to contraction - affects people\u0027s observed \u0027\u0027health behaviours\u0027\u0027, the activities we do that affect our health, such as smoking, drinking, exercising and going for health check-ups.\nAre we healthier during recessions or expansions? The answer isn\u0027t immediately obvious.\nFor instance, do we smoke more during recessions because we are unhappy or during economic good times because we\u0027re stressed out from work?\nDo we exercise more during recessions because we have more free time or during good times because we can afford a gym membership?\nPrevious studies produced conflicting accounts of whether economic expansion was beneficial or detrimental to community health. Studies of long-term joblessness show significant detrimental effects, particularly on mental health.\nSimilarly, one might assume it is obvious that rising incomes would be better for health because more money could be spent on prevention or cures.\nBut good economic times also mean more people are working longer hours compared with recessions when hours are typically cut back. Given that most of us work at a desk these days, more work means more inactivity and less time for working out and incidental exercise.\nSo which is it? Using 50 years of data of 50,000 households in a survey conducted jointly by the US Census Bureau and the Labour Statistics Bureau, the authors of the latest study found a significant relationship between the economic cycle and unhealthy behaviours.\nThey focused on people with low education who were considered more exposed to changes in employment conditions.\nThey found that during economic expansions, people worked longer hours and did fewer time-intensive activities, such as exercising or going to the doctor. They spent more time on quick things, such as smoking.\nSo economic growth makes us do unhealthy things. It\u0027s possible people offset this with other activities not captured by the survey, such as eating better food, but the likely result is that economic good times make us fatter and less healthy.\nGiven the trends of the past few decades of economic prosperity and rising obesity, this at least sounds plausible. Yet governments remain obsessed by growth.\nAnother paper by the Productivity Commission this month comes at the health debate from another perspective - how health factors affect the economy, including wages and productivity. The paper draws on data from the government-funded survey, Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia.\nIt found improvements in health and education directly boosted wages, and in turn productivity (by assuming higher wages are a measure of a worker\u0027s productive ability). The authors found people who suffer from a chronic health disorder earn a lower hourly wage than their healthy counterparts.\nThe effect was clearest for men suffering a \u0027\u0027major injury\u0027\u0027. They could expect an hourly wage 5.4 per cent lower (3.5 per cent for women). The second biggest effect was from poor mental health, which reduced male wages by 4.7 per cent and female wages by 3.1 per cent.\nOther illnesses such as arthritis, cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease also reduced earnings. (Looking at hourly wages strips out the impact of absenteeism and reduced working hours by sick people.) To some extent the finding that sickness reduces productivity is obvious. Depending on your illness, if you are sick you can\u0027t work as hard and might be paid less. But the authors point out that pay safety nets and workers\u0027 compensation modify the effect.\nMore importantly, treating these illnesses could significantly boost wages and productivity across the economy. It suggests investments in improving mental health could pay some of the the biggest dividends.\nThe National Reform Agenda agreed to in 2006 by the Council of Australian Governments is all about boosting productivity and participation by increasing Australia\u0027s \u0027\u0027human capital\u0027\u0027 - the attributes that enable people to work. That includes skills, experience, health and intangible things such as motivation.\nAccording to this paper, we should aim to reduce sickness to accelerate growth. But according to the first paper, accelerating growth could bring its own health problems such as obesity and smoking. Welcome to the crazy treadmill of capitalism. Like rats inside a spinning wheel, we are pumped up by steroids so we can keep working.\nWhat to do about it? Give up a little growth for the sake of our health? Run even faster to deliver the wealth needed to pay to fix the unintended by-products of our successes?\nGrowth and investment in technology have enabled us to treat sickness in ways never thought possible before. If we\u0027d stuck to the agrarian ideal, living on the farm and getting plenty of exercise while we tended to our flock, perhaps we\u0027d all drop dead from the flu or die in childbirth.\nIdeally, a more productive economy will mean we can work fewer hours to achieve the same output.\nTime to knock off for that glass of red, I reckon.\nComments\n1 comments so far\nTo what utopian end are we growing ? I have a bigger television, an electric toothbrush and a car that warms the seat for me.......I should be happier! Recalling my childhood however, it\u0027s clear we\u0027ve paid a heavy toll, the burden of which falls on the vast majority of us. I had a \"free-range\" childhood, a phrase coined by Dick Smith. My children unfortunately, have less freedoms. Oneday, their children, I fear, will live a \"battery\" existence, disconnected from all the natural elements that try to coexist with humanity.\nWe don\u0027t need growth. The fruits are enjoyed by few and funded by many. Let\u0027s recognise the limits of our resources and start to respect the concept of intergenerational equity.\nPostGrowthWorld | ACT             - March 26, 2010, 8:14AM\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

She is quite a change from the procession of bland blokes before her,  and not just because she is female.\nIt used to be that party machines installed women to try to revive the fortunes of ailing governments, such as in 1990 when first Carmen Lawrence became premier of Western Australia and a few months later Joan Kirner took the reins in Victoria.\nThat is no longer an option.  In an era of Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Angela Merkel, Julia Gillard and scores of other credible and competent women politicians, the novelty of having a woman in charge has long gone.\nIn fact, gender was the last thing on the minds of the  machine men when they got rid of Nathan Rees. Sussex Street had wanted Frank Sartor but the Right faction split and the machine could not deliver. Kristina Keneally put her hand up and tip-toed through the middle of the carnage.\nNow, three months later, she is surprising her colleagues with how popular she is - 73 per of us like her, according to a recent Galaxy poll - and even impressing factional rivals with how she is conducting herself in the job.\nCabinet colleagues speak of the \"amazing\" way she has  grown into the job, her easy grasp of complex issues and of the way she runs cabinet.  \"There is a level of consultation I\u0027ve never seen before,\" says one senior minister.\nHer personal popularity is not rubbing off on the government, which still is totally on the nose with voters and is almost certain to be tipped out next March. But she has energised NSW politics and is providing the Opposition Leader, Barry O\u0027Farrell, with some cause for concern.\nBeside her, he looks dull and verbose.  And old.  The Premier is a bike-riding, football-playing barrel of energy who dresses smartly, gives good soundbite  and has a gorgeous photogenic family to round off the package.\nShe ticks a lot of boxes: working mother, immigrant (whose accent is less of an issue that it might have been), Catholic (but not zealous, like the federal Opposition Leader) and it doesn\u0027t hurt that she has married into the family of one of the country\u0027s most beloved writers, Tom Keneally.\nShe is on a punishing media schedule, providing at least one good television opportunity virtually every day - and this is helping boost her popularity - and then there\u0027s her day job. She is running a government, which means Parliament, cabinet, endless meetings and the politics of it all to consider.  No wonder, she said recently, she\u0027s too tired at the end of the day for \"prayer and reflection\".\nBut it will be how she performs as Premier that will determine whether she can put on a credible showing at next year\u0027s election.\nThere have been some changes in the tone of how the government operates.  \"Our table  manners are better,\" says one insider.  Less knuckle-dragging and more civility and reasoned argument apparently.  No one questions that Keneally is intelligent, disciplined and determined.\nBut is she her own woman?  Was Nathan Rees correct to predict that she would be the puppet of Joe Tripodi and Eddie Obeid? Is Eric Roozendaal really running the show? These are the questions that are buzzing around political circles.  And what is interesting is that there are no firm answers.\nThis means that Keneally is either smarter than she was given credit for - her friends say this - or, the cynical view, her handlers are a sophisticated bunch who understand that her only chance for averting an  electoral train-wreck is for her to strongly differentiate herself from the party.\nThis will take more than leaving the Labor Party\u0027s name off the glossy brochures showcasing the Premier, as was done with the recent publicity blitz around her first 100 days in office.\nRees won voter respect when he stood up to the party machine on selecting his own cabinet, but it cost him his job.  Bob Carr needed to win an election before he had the clout to take on the factions.\nThe challenge facing Keneally is to find a way to exert her authority in a highly visible manner.  She has strong cards because the party can\u0027t afford to dump her during the countdown to the election but does she have the intestinal fortitude for a bruising fight with the people who helped put her there?\nThere is growing goodwill towards our personable Premier, even from people who have written off the state government. But she has to demonstrate that she has the stature and the stamina to fix a state that her party is largely responsible for running down in the first place.\nHer experience is thin, compared with, say, that of Anna Bligh, who served a real apprenticeship for the job as Queensland\u0027s Premier. It\u0027s a highwire act, the likes of which we have not seen in Sydney for decades.\nBut you have to say that someone who recently nominated as her favourite book Unlocking Land Values to Finance Urban Infrastructure is at least taking the job pretty seriously.\nComments\n15 comments so far\nHaving had some involvement with the current Premier\u0027s office, I can confirm there is nothing \u0027sophisticated\u0027 about her handlers whatsoever. She, however, is articulate, willing to learn (as opposed to the handlers who whizz and out of meetings attached to their mobiles), able to retain loads of infomation and - importantly - evidently able to make her own decisions. And with a smile.\nI am waiting now for Barry O\u0027Farrell to come up with some convincing policies so we can really make a decision...\nRando - March 26, 2010, 6:53AM\nLove her face, love her accent but she\u0027s labor and they\u0027ve done nothing good for NSW (can she be named sexiest politician of the year?)\nED | Sydney             - March 26, 2010, 6:28AM\n\"Look, people of NSW, shiny bauble, shiny bauble.

But the Queenslander has already shown he can  do almost as much damage to Abbott from the inside as he did to Malcolm Turnbull from the outside.\nIn finance, he threatened the Coalition\u0027s economic credentials, the bedrock of its appeal to the electorate, as he mixed up net and gross debt and prophesised \u0027\u0027economic armageddon\u0027\u0027 as the United States  defaulted on its borrowings and Australia\u0027s debt became unserviceable.\nIn his new portfolio of infrastructure, regional development and water, he could cause a whole new kind of grief.\nHe is now in charge of sorting out a split between the Nationals and the Liberals over  Abbott\u0027s threat to hold a referendum on  a federal takeover of the Murray Darling basin.\nFederal National backbenchers, the NSW Nationals and NSW irrigators have rejected the idea. Nationals leader Warren Truss has said pointedly it is not Nationals\u0027 policy. But South Australian Liberals - four of whom hold marginal seats - say their voters love it, and see it as the solution to upstream irrigators   using all the water.\nNow Joyce, defender of the rights of upstream irrigators, has to adjudicate the fight. He has already suggested giving power to a \u0027\u0027committee of people from all reaches of the river\u0027\u0027 rather than the federal minister.\nJoyce is often under-estimated and is great on the hustings. His new job will show whether he can also master the etiquette of working from the inside.\nComments\n16 comments so far\nThe old \u0027 be careful what you wish for \u0027 line comes to mind.\nLabour pushed for Barnaby to be moved from finance now he is out from behind the desk and is hitting the streets to do what he does best talk and connect to rural Australia.\nFrom a labour perspective I think he was safer behind a desk up to his armpits in figures not questioning ETS, BER, boat people, Broadband rollout etc etc etc\npbm - March 26, 2010, 6:43AM\nNo win situation here for Abbott. Wherever Joyce is placed it will cause problems for the Libs.\nsparky | castlecrag             - March 26, 2010, 7:00AM\nBut is he that good on the hustings ? People are not buying it. Barnaby is often incoherent and I think people see through his ramblings. We could be unkind like Miranda Devine and say he might have some appeal to the \" morons\" out there, like she did yesterday about the so called worm audience, but its laughable how it seems that this mess of an opposition somehow has to be taken seriously when they are a shambles. Barnaby can barely string a sentance together. Abbott thinks interjection and and arrogance can stand in for a debate ( barely an outline of a policy) and then they have Bronwyn Bishop on the front bench, Minchins gone...Turnbulls out in the cold...blah, blah, blah !\nDavid | NSW             - March 26, 2010, 7:05AM\nAbbot\u0027s threat to hold a referendum on a Fed takeover of the Murray is just that, a threat and an empty one at that.\nJoyce has been moved as he is a liability because of his penchant for opening his mouth and stuffing both his feet in it and in the process stealing the headlines for anything else Abbot has had planned .He cant be entirely removed from the front bench as this would cause massive ructions in the Lib/Nat coalition so hes been dropped down and shuffled off to one side in the hope that this portfolio will give him less exposure and he will be under a tighter rein . Minchin resigning for whatever reason is a body blow to the right wing dries of the Liberal Party and it will be interesting to see who the new power broker is when the dust settles after his departure.\nmirrors of smoke | sydney             - March 26, 2010, 7:25AM\nHey David he must be ok as he led the fight from the ground against the flawed ETS policy, This went from the biggest issue of our generation according to Kevin Rudd to barely rating a mention thanks to the charge led by Barnaby.\nIf you believe he will not make a difference in regards to the key seats up and down the Murray Darling basin and in Qld where he is liked then I don\u0027t think you are looking at the topic objectively.\nI personally have issues with some things Barnaby says but he gets his point across and is popular on the ground in certain areas of australia which is what Kevin Rudd would fear.\nAl - March 26, 2010, 7:37AM\nWhatever happens, I know one thing for sure and that is that, Tony Abbott is an absolute psychopath. Hence the name Tony \u0027Psychotic\u0027 Abbott.\nBarnaby Joyce being himself and picking on all deals and transactions and talking to rural Australia worked much better for Labour in the past. He was there during Brendan Nelson, he was there during Malcolm Turnbull and was there even when Kevin Rudd smashed Howard into little pieces at the last Federal Election.\nI certainly think that Abbott brings out that convict/criminal/aggressive/snarl at everything connection in certain people - certain sectors of Anglo Saxon Australia, in-love with the good old days of segregation, hate, division, us v them...But that\u0027s all. Any positive being broadcast is being generated by that group.\nI personally thing that Malcom Turnbull would have been the perfect choice as shadow treasurer, as a. investment banker he made his fortune, being very good with money. But such is the level of hate emanating from Abbott that he turns a blind eye to the stars of his own party out of vengeance and spite.\nGood one Abbot you psychotic monkey.\nRob | Sydney             - March 26, 2010, 7:47AM\nHow many times since 2007 have the Libs had leadership changes or bench rearrangements?\nDo the Libs honestly think that any of this is going to work.\nAnd to cap it off, when Abbott first took over, he was into lycra and budgie smugglers. Abbott failed badly on Monday in the debate and he is into pink lycra? Somehow this is suppose to impress the voting public? Is this fellow for real or do the Libs think any of this can undo the damage being done?\nAt the last Fed election one of the catchcry\u0027s was that the Libs were out of touch. Lycra and bench shakes up still show us how out of touch the Libs are.\nHow hum, onto the next saga. What has Abbott in store for us next week\ncb - March 26, 2010, 7:57AM\nJoyce was right. Everyone knows that Labor governments never pay back debt.\nThe people in the regions love Joyce. Labor was better off with him in the Finance portfolio. He is now free to hold forth on the ETS, pink batts and refugees. As well as attacking Sydneyites and Melbournians.\nGeorge | Mawson, ACT             - March 26, 2010, 7:58AM\nAside from being an incoherent nincompoop, Joyce thinks he is playing a game and treats every media opportunity like a circus featuring himself as the cheif clown.\nDaisey May | Brisbane             - March 26, 2010, 7:58AM\nWe can\u0027t forget Joyce\u0027s defence of the lunatic in the tree either. Abbott really hasn\u0027t thought out what he is doing with Joyce. Putting Joyce anywhere near water suggests there is a drought of talent in the Coal-ition. I feel sorry for Andrew Robb, he\u0027s being handed a bucket with a hole in it.\nRob Banks | Stanmore NSW             - March 26, 2010, 8:02AM\nShow more comments\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

Soon, it will be time to knock off, crack open a bottle of wine and begin erasing memories of the week that was. Personally, I will be trying to get back the hour I spent watching Kevin Rudd\u0027s glued-on grin and listening to Tony Abbott\u0027s fake laugh. Aren\u0027t we glad that\u0027s over?\nThe debate dominated the news but big ideas on health still seem to be missing in action. So try this one on for size: the economy is making us fat.\nA study by Xin Xu and Robert Kaestner from the University of Illinois examined how the business cycle - the swings in the economy from expansion to contraction - affects people\u0027s observed \u0027\u0027health behaviours\u0027\u0027, the activities we do that affect our health, such as smoking, drinking, exercising and going for health check-ups.\nAre we healthier during recessions or expansions? The answer isn\u0027t immediately obvious.\nFor instance, do we smoke more during recessions because we are unhappy or during economic good times because we\u0027re stressed out from work?\nDo we exercise more during recessions because we have more free time or during good times because we can afford a gym membership?\nPrevious studies produced conflicting accounts of whether economic expansion was beneficial or detrimental to community health. Studies of long-term joblessness show significant detrimental effects, particularly on mental health.\nSimilarly, one might assume it is obvious that rising incomes would be better for health because more money could be spent on prevention or cures.\nBut good economic times also mean more people are working longer hours compared with recessions when hours are typically cut back. Given that most of us work at a desk these days, more work means more inactivity and less time for working out and incidental exercise.\nSo which is it? Using 50 years of data of 50,000 households in a survey conducted jointly by the US Census Bureau and the Labour Statistics Bureau, the authors of the latest study found a significant relationship between the economic cycle and unhealthy behaviours.\nThey focused on people with low education who were considered more exposed to changes in employment conditions.\nThey found that during economic expansions, people worked longer hours and did fewer time-intensive activities, such as exercising or going to the doctor. They spent more time on quick things, such as smoking.\nSo economic growth makes us do unhealthy things. It\u0027s possible people offset this with other activities not captured by the survey, such as eating better food, but the likely result is that economic good times make us fatter and less healthy.\nGiven the trends of the past few decades of economic prosperity and rising obesity, this at least sounds plausible. Yet governments remain obsessed by growth.\nAnother paper by the Productivity Commission this month comes at the health debate from another perspective - how health factors affect the economy, including wages and productivity. The paper draws on data from the government-funded survey, Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia.\nIt found improvements in health and education directly boosted wages, and in turn productivity (by assuming higher wages are a measure of a worker\u0027s productive ability). The authors found people who suffer from a chronic health disorder earn a lower hourly wage than their healthy counterparts.\nThe effect was clearest for men suffering a \u0027\u0027major injury\u0027\u0027. They could expect an hourly wage 5.4 per cent lower (3.5 per cent for women). The second biggest effect was from poor mental health, which reduced male wages by 4.7 per cent and female wages by 3.1 per cent.\nOther illnesses such as arthritis, cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease also reduced earnings. (Looking at hourly wages strips out the impact of absenteeism and reduced working hours by sick people.) To some extent the finding that sickness reduces productivity is obvious. Depending on your illness, if you are sick you can\u0027t work as hard and might be paid less. But the authors point out that pay safety nets and workers\u0027 compensation modify the effect.\nMore importantly, treating these illnesses could significantly boost wages and productivity across the economy. It suggests investments in improving mental health could pay some of the the biggest dividends.\nThe National Reform Agenda agreed to in 2006 by the Council of Australian Governments is all about boosting productivity and participation by increasing Australia\u0027s \u0027\u0027human capital\u0027\u0027 - the attributes that enable people to work. That includes skills, experience, health and intangible things such as motivation.\nAccording to this paper, we should aim to reduce sickness to accelerate growth. But according to the first paper, accelerating growth could bring its own health problems such as obesity and smoking. Welcome to the crazy treadmill of capitalism. Like rats inside a spinning wheel, we are pumped up by steroids so we can keep working.\nWhat to do about it? Give up a little growth for the sake of our health? Run even faster to deliver the wealth needed to pay to fix the unintended by-products of our successes?\nGrowth and investment in technology have enabled us to treat sickness in ways never thought possible before. If we\u0027d stuck to the agrarian ideal, living on the farm and getting plenty of exercise while we tended to our flock, perhaps we\u0027d all drop dead from the flu or die in childbirth.\nIdeally, a more productive economy will mean we can work fewer hours to achieve the same output.\nTime to knock off for that glass of red, I reckon.\nComments\n1 comments so far\nTo what utopian end are we growing ? I have a bigger television, an electric toothbrush and a car that warms the seat for me.......I should be happier! Recalling my childhood however, it\u0027s clear we\u0027ve paid a heavy toll, the burden of which falls on the vast majority of us. I had a \"free-range\" childhood, a phrase coined by Dick Smith. My children unfortunately, have less freedoms. Oneday, their children, I fear, will live a \"battery\" existence, disconnected from all the natural elements that try to coexist with humanity.\nWe don\u0027t need growth. The fruits are enjoyed by few and funded by many. Let\u0027s recognise the limits of our resources and start to respect the concept of intergenerational equity.\nPostGrowthWorld | ACT             - March 26, 2010, 8:14AM\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

This is the outfit driven by the main newspaper groups (including Fairfax) and broadcasters to lobby for fewer legal impediments that get in the way of reporters\u0027 access to information.\nA quick check of the Right to Know\u0027s website shows the last big thing to happen was a big free speech jamboree in Sydney a year ago. There have been no papers, reports or analysis since 2008.\nMaybe it\u0027s because The Australian newspaper has decided to change sides and go into the suppression business.\nMedia Watch had a great story about it on this week\u0027s episode. It goes back to an equally great story by The Australian reporter Cameron Stewart about federal and Victorian police being \u0027\u0027poised to swoop\u0027\u0027 on members of a suspected terrorist cell who planned an attack on the Holsworthy army barracks.\nStewart was tipped off by a police officer about the impending raid. There were undertakings given by the paper as to the timing of the publication, and allegations from the Victorian police commissioner and others that the undertaking was breached.\nFor its part the paper disputes that, and says it did everything it could to observe the requirement the report not be published before the raid taking place on the morning of August 4 last year. There is evidence to say the story was available at 1.30am on the day of the raid.\nThings have moved on a bit, and it is not really the main story now. Last week Stewart picked up a Gold Quill award for his efforts from the Melbourne Press Club. In the process he said it was the most difficult story he has worked on. The police integrity people in Victoria and Canberra have had the thumbscrews on him trying to extract his source for the story.\nEven though the reporter was unwilling to assist them with their inquiries, it appears the Office of Police Integrity in Victoria and the Commonwealth\u0027s Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity know the name of the source, who was suspended from duty last October.\nBefore tabling in both the Commonwealth and Victorian parliaments, a draft report of the whole incident has been prepared and, as is usual, a copy was sent to the \u0027\u0027stakeholders\u0027\u0027, which include The Australian.\nThe newspaper was subject to criticism and it didn\u0027t like it one bit. So much so, it has gone to the Federal Court seeking a permanent injunction against various integrity agencies to prevent publication of their report.\nJustice Michelle Gordon granted an interim injunction last week, and set the whole thing down for a full hearing on April 12.\nParliament will just have to wait to hear what\u0027s going on, which in itself might raise some interesting issues of privilege. Importantly, you will have to hold your breath as well.\nThe application made by the publisher of The Australian and its editor, Paul Whittaker, complains the police integrity agencies acted beyond their power in as much as the newspaper is outside its jurisdiction.\nIt may be that issue has already been resolved in favour of the investigators by the NSW appeal court in the case of Jeff Shaw against the NSW Police Integrity Commission.\nThe application to the Federal Court contends the draft report contains \u0027\u0027matters critical of the conduct of the applicants that adversely affects the business and commercial reputation of the [publisher] and the personal and professional reputation of the [editor]\u0027\u0027.\nBut when it came time for the senior people at The Australian to respond to Media Watch inquiries, the argument was pitched somewhat differently.\nThe editor-in-chief, Chris Mitchell, said the report was shoddy and it \u0027\u0027inadvertently or otherwise\u0027\u0027 discloses the identity of the confidential source.\nThe odd thing is, nowhere in the application or the transcript of the hearing for the interim injunction is the protection of the source raised as a distinct issue. The Australian and Stewart are bound to keep the identity of the police officer confidential, but it\u0027s a stretch too far to say no one else as part of an official inquiry can identify the source of the information. Certainly it\u0027s not a scenario contemplated by the journalists\u0027 code of ethics, which simply says \u0027\u0027where confidences are accepted, respect them in all circumstances\u0027\u0027.\nA newspaper seeking injunctions to prevent the publication of information is a decidedly bad look. It\u0027s not as though this Murdoch organ can\u0027t defend itself. A week ago it was giving the Victorian police and the Office of Police Integrity a thorough tickle-up over investigations, or lack thereof, of complaints about police racism.\nAs to trying to stop the publication of something \u0027\u0027shoddy\u0027\u0027, if that argument succeeded some newspapers would be looking very thin indeed.\njustinian@lawpress.com.au\nComments\n2 comments so far\nif you want free speech, you need democracy.\nin a monarchy, the concept is meaningless. how can there be free speech when a power separate from the people has the means to compel silence?\nincidentally, even in a democracy, freedom of speech is really freedom to know: the electorate allows and encourages free speech so that the knowledge necessary to the conduct of democracy is available to all.\nin a monarchy, the people know little and have even less power to act. in such a society, talking about freedom of speech is always naive, where it is not mere hypocrisy.\nal loomis | central coast             - March 26, 2010, 7:28AM\nCould it be that the real story behind this is that the \"leaking\" of the story to the \u0027Australian\u0027 was in actuality a politically motivated and approved public relations exercise to give the appearance that governments were right on top of things in the so called \"war on terror\"?\nThe media would be on hand to show the exciting derring-do as our protectors dragged bleary brown-eyed suspects and their families from their homes into the early dawn.\nInept and lazy governments always like to appear to the dull of mind that they are doing something.\nOr was it the police wanting publicity to encourage their political masters to allocate more funds and resources?\nUnfortunately the flaw of secret police around the world is that their culture of \u0027secrecy\u0027 often compromises internal communications and the actual delivery date of newspapers perhaps was not accurately advised to those on the ground carrying out the operation?\nIn the United States there would still a chance of the truth coming out. The inheritance of a deep British ruling class suspicion of what information the classes below can be trusted with make it unlikely here.\nMichael Rogers - March 26, 2010, 8:38AM\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

The perception became commonplace that the government was rotten.\nTasmanians let this pass for a very long time because they were frightened, because any who came between the ALP and its exercise of power had their lives made miserable.\nBut the greatest cost was in the end to the ALP itself, which ceased to become a force for any progressive politics. It lied, it deceived, it sold Tasmania\u0027s soul for a mess of pottage, all so it could keep itself in privilege.\nSo far to the right did the Tasmanian ALP move that Robin Gray, the former Liberal premier and board member of the timber company Gunns, last year proposed a Liberal-Labor coalition on the ground that nothing now divided the two major parties and it would keep the Greens out of power.\n\u0027\u0027No policy issue,\u0027\u0027 Mark Latham has said, \u0027\u0027or set of relationships better demonstrates the ethical decline and political corruption of the Australian Labor movement than Tasmanian forestry.\u0027\u0027\nBut that is only half the story: the other half is that its desire to destroy the Greens led the Tasmanian ALP to so many of the poisonous accommodations it made with the forestry industry.\nAnd last Saturday Tasmanians made it clear they had had enough.\nLindsay Tanner wrote on this page yesterday that the high Green vote represented the defection of the educated and the affluent from Labor\u0027s ranks.\nBut this is a myth. The collapse of the Labor vote was about the many people who are neither educated nor affluent having had enough of what they perceived to be the collusion of Tasmanian Labor with corporations against their interests.\nOne Tasmanian Green MP, Kim Booth, is a sawmiller, more a lager guzzler than a cafe hopper. Another Green MP, Tim Morris, was the highest votegetter in the electorate of Lyons, which combines rural and forestry areas with some of the poorest public housing estates in Australia.\nThe former Liberal leader Rene Hidding put Morris\u0027s unprecedented vote down to the fact people in that electorate - which Gunns has papered with its highly unpopular plantations - were frightened their drinking water was poisoned by the plantations.\nIt was, then, not the latte sippers voting Green but the poison swillers frightened of what they believed the unholy union of corporate power and the ALP may have done to them.\nTanner is right to argue the ALP treats the rise of the Greens in Tasmania seriously as a national portent. But, in suggesting the ALP sees the Greens as a new enemy, he is repeating the terrible mistake made by the Tasmanian ALP that left it politically gangrenous and led it to its drubbing in the election.\nThe conservative forces in this country have rarely been so foolish.\nThey have governed nationally for long periods through embracing rather than destroying other conservative forces - the Democratic Labor Party, the National Party in its various guises.\nThe embrace was not always easy or straightforward, the differences sometimes substantial and even, as with Joh for PM, destructive. But the overall effect was large and infinitely valuable.\nIt gave the Liberal Party power again and again when it would otherwise not have had it. And the less noted consequence was that it constantly tempered some of the Liberal Party\u0027s excesses, while opening it to a constant source of vitality and difference.\nIn Tasmania some Labor elders are beginning to question the old nostrum that the Greens are the wreckers of progressive hope. This week the former Tasmanian ALP minister, state secretary and senator Terry Aulich called on Labor \u0027\u0027to seize the day\u0027\u0027.\nIn a local paper Aulich wrote the Greens \u0027\u0027have a lot to contribute\u0027\u0027 and argued an agreement between Labor and the Greens was \u0027\u0027essential\u0027\u0027.\nCome the federal election, pundits are predicting the Greens gaining the balance of power in the Senate. The ALP can choose to treat this as an opportunity, as helping them to prosecute a more progressive agenda. Or it can make the mistake it made for too long in Tasmania and treat the Greens as its greatest enemy.\nThrough the 20th century, Big Brother was the state. In the 21st, it may well be the corporation, be it Gunns or Halliburton or the coal industry. We need corporations as we need states but, as the global financial crisis has shown, as climate change demands, we need checks upon their excessive powers.\nIn that battle the progressive forces could do worse than come together, recognising their differences, accepting their conflicts, but avoiding the unforgivable crime of fratricide. And who knows? In the mash-up there just might arise a better future.\nRichard Flanagan is an author.\nComments\n15 comments so far\nIn politics, as in business, true competition and real choice makes for good outcomes..\nHere\u0027s hoping the Greens represent a real choice for voters and the we\u0027re about to see the breakup of the current Labor/Liberal logjam.\nDavid | Leongatha             - March 26, 2010, 6:50AM\nLindsay Tanner was writing more about Melbourne than Tasmania, but Richard Flanagan\u0027s diatribe does give further evidence about the true motives, and tactics, of the Greens. The first thing Flanagan does is attack Jim Bacon, who is dead. He does this by attacking his connection with a union. Jim Bacon was one of the most respected and liked Premiers in Tasmania\u0027s history. With such a cheap shot to start with, the rest of Flanagan\u0027s stuff is just self justification for trying to wreck Labor.\nPaul | Melb             - March 26, 2010, 7:23AM\nLabour attacks the Greens because the Greens are the substance to Labour\u0027s style. They can\u0027t have a viable alternative that actually will achieve what Labour promises. Besides their corporate backers don\u0027t like it either.\nMichael | Melbourne             - March 26, 2010, 8:21AM\ncouldn\u0027t agree more Richard.\nscott | here             - March 26, 2010, 8:18AM\nYes, Richard you have some good points.\nBut I think Labor also need to ensure that the voting public know that the Greens are siding mostly with the Libs.\nFor those who had been sending some votes Green\u0027s way or thinking of doing so in the future, this is need to know information and enough to change my mind against Greens in the future\ncb - March 26, 2010, 8:03AM\nThe Greens represent the only real hope of any change in the game of Tweedledum and Tweedledee that the mainstream parties have become. Both are, like the Democrats and the Republicans in the US, two arms of the business party. We need a new politics that listens to the voters, not to the corporations. The Greens seem the only ones prepared to do that.\nLesm | Balmain             - March 26, 2010, 8:00AM\nGood shot, Richard, straight to the fence for 4. The Tasmanian election, with its likely 10-10-5 result, is a final mathematical proof that Labor and Liberal would rather lose an election than lose their vested (forestry) interests. Similarly, on the mainland, Labor and Liberal refuse to even discuss population, even though each side knows that low-population policies could be election-winners in 2010. And what about all those journalists who used to try to tell us that Tanner was a \u0027deep thinker\u0027 for Labor, when actually he appears to be stuck with Arthur Calwell and the Yoonyins back in the 1950s?\nStephen - March 26, 2010, 8:27AM\nThere is a huge disconnection between curiosity- and altruism-driven Science and dishonesty- and greed-driven Politics in Australia.\nThis is best illustrated by the irresponsible inaction of the Liberal-National Coalition and Labor (the Lib-Labs) in relation to man-made global warming in the face of long-standing warnings from scientists about the worsening climate emergency.\nTraditional altruistic, democratic, anti-war, pro-environment, anti-racism Labor voters have been betrayed by a new greed-based, Lobbyist-beholden, pro-war, anti-environment and Indigenous rights-violating Australian Labor Party (aka Another Liberal Party or the Apartheid Labor Party)..\nIt was accordingly very heartening to see the 21% support for the Greens and the move away from the anti-science, anti-environment, pro-coal, pro-war, Tammany Hall Australian Labor Party in the recent Tasmanian elections.\nTop climate scientists, including the British Royal Society Coral Working Group, are proscribing a reduction of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration from the current damaging 390 parts per million (ppm) to a safe and sustainable level of about 300 ppm (for details see \"300.org\" which wants 300 ppm CO2 for a safe planet for all peoples and all species).\nUnfortunately, world governments are hell-bent on increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, led most notoriously by the lobbyist-beholden, spin-obsessed, anti-science Australian Labor Government. Thus Australia has about 0.3% of the world\u0027s population but Australia\u0027s annual Domestic plus Exported greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution is about 3% of the world total.\nInformed and responsible Australians have no choice but to vote Green Number One and to Put Labor Last - the key arguments being that the incompetent incumbent must be punished and you cannot sensibly vote for a Labor Party that betrays its own supporters.\nDr Gideon Polya | Macleod             - March 26, 2010, 8:33AM\nI obviously meant to say above that top scientists are PRESCRIBING (recommending) 300 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration for a safe planet.\nDr Gideon Polya | Macleod             - March 26, 2010, 8:38AM\nGood article.\nLabor must truly be scared to so openly attack the Greens in such a pathetic and transparant manner.\nKev must know he is staring at possible defeat or at least embarrassment if any federal election were to be held soon. He\u0027s not worried about the Liberals, as long as Abbott leads, they won\u0027t get the popular vote. So Labor attacks the party that has filled the void Labor left when they became an ultra conservative, right wing party - the Greens.\nSo I say this to Kev.\nGet rid of Conroy!\nDrop the mandatory internet filter!\nHave an inquiry into Conroy\u0027s $250 million tax cut to Channels 7, 9 \u0026 10 and why none of these TV stations have not presented negative commentary over the internt filter!\nStop kneeling to the almighty Australian Christian Lobby and stand up for yourself, for your nation, for the people who voted you in with high hopes and have now seen them dashed!\nUntil Kev stands up from under the shadow of the ACL and Conroy goes, Labor does not deserve our vote. I will be voting Greens for the very first time.\nRob | Sydney             - March 26, 2010, 8:48AM\nShow more comments\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

I was sent the same \u0027\u0027termination\u0027\u0027 letter three times, multiple pages of convoluted insurance-speak I had come to know well after living for a decade in California.\nI went to live in the US in 1999 for my American-born husband William to have treatment for a brain tumour. Over 10 years he had four brain operations, six weeks of radiation, numerous rounds of chemotherapy, immunotherapy and multiple prescription medications.\nMy husband might have been battling cancer, but the battle with the insurance companies proved just as sickening. Each time William had a brain operation we would receive a bill - usually in the vicinity of $50,000-$80,000 for the operation and three-day hospital stay - despite the fact we paid a hefty premium and the insurance company intended to pay costs.\nI\u0027ve heard often that unsuspecting and unwell patients who are insured have paid hefty medical bills because they are vulnerable, confused, tired of being harassed by hospital billing departments or simply didn\u0027t understand the insurance jargon that the bill was the responsibility of the insurance company, not the patient.\nThe day William\u0027s doctors gave him the \u0027\u0027go home and die speech\u0027\u0027 in 2005 we went home and within an hour the hospital billing department called, followed by his insurance company, disputing a $2000 bill for a brain scan in 2003 they claimed was not pre-approved by his insurer. It was.\nI yelled down the phone to them both something along the lines of: leave us alone, let my 41-year-old husband spend some time with his son and die with some dignity, not on-hold on the phone to an insurance company mid-medical bill dispute.\nWilliam died peacefully at home a few months later. The calls from the insurance company stopped because the debt collectors took over. It was tempting in my grieving state to write them a cheque and be done with the harassment. Instead, I kept my husband\u0027s advice firmly in mind: \u0027\u0027Don\u0027t pay them a cent.\u0027\u0027\nI wrote multiple letters and enlisted the help of William\u0027s doctors to prove no money was owed. The bills continued two years after he died.\nThe term \u0027\u0027socialised medicine\u0027\u0027 was invented by the American Medical Association in 1947 to disparage president Harry Truman\u0027s proposal for a national healthcare system. It was a ploy to protect the interests of the US medical insurance industry, and the term was resurrected by Ronald Reagan to counter Jimmy Carter\u0027s campaign for national insurance. Yet ask any American what\u0027s so bad about \"socialised medicine\" and they are clueless.\nThere are some huge steps forward in Obama\u0027s healthcare package. If you have a pre-existing condition, for instance, you cannot be denied insurance. But the problem with the US health system isÂ the insurance companies - whoever administers them: private companies or the state. This reform plan still means the uninsured need to be insured - there\u0027s no plan for a public system like Australia\u0027s.\nJust what exactly Obama\u0027s reforms mean for patients remains unclear. All I know is that when I moved back to Sydney last year one of my greatest reliefs, and proudest moments as an Australian, was re-enrolling and receiving my Medicare card for me and my son.\nIt will give me great pleasure to write to his American health insurer to say its services will no longer be required. I won my final battle the only way I know how: I left the country.\nHelen Pitt is a Herald journalist.\nComments\n119 comments so far\nI find it tragic that so many Americans seem to believe universal healthcare equates with a limitation of their liberty. Early last century American liberal theorist, John Dewey, asked what is the meaning of such \u0027liberty\", and why were, even then, so many establishment figures of the opinion that only their version of liberty was the correct one. He didn\u0027t fully answer his own question, but in his partial answer he claimed that the maximising of liberty in society equated to a limitation of liberty for the privileged, and so was vehemently opposed by an opinion that the establishment had the resources to manufacture. In this era of \"the sound-bite\" and vertical integration, with News Ltd and Fox having such a disproportionate influence, Dewey\u0027s prediction has been realised.\nBritish liberal professor TG Green, said that the incremental limitation of liberty through private contracts was at least as big a threat to liberty as despotism. The limitation of American liberty by health insurance companies seems to have borne Green out, what is staggering is that it has taken the land of the free so bloody long to realise it, and that so many there still do not.\nSean og O\u0027Coinne | Dapto             - March 25, 2010, 7:17AM\ni happened to channel surf onto \"Oprah\" a few months ago anfd stayed watching. She devoted the whole show to a tour of, I think, Denmark\u0027s societal system. The contrast with the Danish system and the outcomes on Danish society were looked at and gently, for the sake of her American audience, juxtaposed with the American system. I remember thinking that was an incredibly brave thing for her to do, given the rabid attitudes of a large number of Americans to being shown anything better than their system. For America to have a medical system that refuses help to 36 million of it\u0027s own citizens and bankrupts people over medical bills is a triumph of ideology and ignorance over common sense.\nBillR - March 25, 2010, 7:54AM\nWhether socialised health care is better than private insurance is not a given - even philisophically - but rather depends on the costs and benefits of one system over the other. Mr Obama\u0027s scheme will cost $1 trillion to cover 30 million Americans - or $333,333 per person! - at least some of whom have deliberately opted out of health insurance for good financial reasons. Australia\u0027s system of combining the best features of private and public healthcare is very good, much better than the NHS in Britain in my experience. As popualtions age and we all live longer, the cost of healthcare will rise rapidly. I have seen estimates of 20% of GDP or half of all government spending. This is plainly \u0027unsustainable\u0027 to use trendy jargon. The question is not private versus public, as the ideologues on the left maintain, but how much health care we really need, what can be afforded and how best to match demand and need to supply. It seems in the example quoted that the insured person\u0027s bills were in fact paid, but that bossy accounts departments sent out misleading letters and made annoying phone calls. The gentleman who died was treated, and chose to be treated in America rather than Australia. Insurance companies can be annoying and cause distress, but they are not alone in this - how often do we spend time arguing with banks and local councils? The real test must be whether they pay the bills or not? BTW, America arleady has a system of Medicare and Medicaid.\nJohn Montgomery - March 25, 2010, 8:37AM\nOne wonders what American hear about Medicare, if anything - and if any of them thought it worthwhile to ask the opinion of anyone living in a country with a national health service - Australia and Britain, for a start. There are plenty of ex-pat US citizens living in both countries.\nMerri - March 25, 2010, 8:48AM\nSorry Merri, but the US has its own Medicare system, paid for jointly by the Federal government and the States who administer the programme. It is a health insurance programme covering medical bills, hospital care and prescriptions. There is also Medicaid, a federal programme, which is an entitlement programme for the poor and sick. Of the 30 million uncovered Americans, about 12 million are illegal immigrants and a large number are people who prefer to pay their own bills if and when required. I know many Americans living in the UK who go private and even go back to the USA to have their babies because the NHS hospitals are so filthy.\nJohn Montgomery - March 25, 2010, 9:41AM\nHealth care in the US is a complicated topic. Point blank, Americans hate paying taxes. National health care means more taxes, increased waiting times, and lower quality service. We have all read about NSW\u0027s hospital woes and inability to receive prompt treatment. Americans want quantity of life, not quality of life. Only 50% of Americans pay taxes. They are not willing to support those who don\u0027t. Add to it, an increasingly aging population and the question is: Who is going to pay?\nComparing Oz to the US is not a good comparison. Aussies like their \"nanny government.\" 50% of Americans - those who are paying - don\u0027t cotton to the \"nanny state.\" Many Americans could afford to pay for health insurance if they would make personal sacrifices. They don\u0027t want to make sacrifices. They have a \"me first\" attitude that precludes a rational approach to anything. The left wants entitlement programs, most which would be paid for by the right. The right doesn\u0027t want to support those who do not want to work or make sacrifices in their own lives. Why should they?\nThe health care bill passed will eventually bankrupt the country. It is pure folly to pass an entitlement program when the country has the highest deficits of anyplace in the world, and keeps on adding to them. I have yet to see any government run any program that will save taxpayers any money at all. Cost estimates are always low - and actual costs are often 20 times the estimates. You only need to look at your own health care system objectively to know that it isn\u0027t really working all that well either. Giving birth in a hospital toilet? Great system! No beds? Great system! The list is endless.\nOld Codger - March 25, 2010, 10:20AM\nSad article on what happens when misery and illness become an opportunity to make (even more) money. Love him or loathe him, Micheal Moore gets to the point in his movie \u0027Sicko\u0027 - the sight of US Firemen who worked at Ground Zero having to travel to Cuba to get care should make every American angry and every Australian very relieved.\nSooty | sydney             - March 25, 2010, 10:24AM\nAdjacent to this article is Miranda Divine\u0027s column which includes her unfortunate experience at a Sydney hospital ER with a severed thumb-tip. Due to the failings of the health/hospital system, she could not have the correct surgery to save the nerve endings in her thumb. Much worse things happen everyday in the public Australian system, and private insurance cover is NOT a panacea for these shortcomings. The US healthcare reforms may, in time, evolve to include a single-payer option but I laud the government for enacting reforms to the private health system there. I have lived in both countries and was very fortunate to have had excellent health insurance in the US, which cannot be equalled in Australia even with private cover. Waiting times to see specialists is excessive and unreasonable, and access to needed ER treatment is inadequate. If Miranda Devine had injured her thumb while on holidays in the US and had a travel insurance policy in effect, I am nearly 100% certain she would not have a numb thumb.\nGinny - March 25, 2010, 10:32AM\nJohn Montgomery - fair dinkum mate - you can try to defend the US system as much as you like - the reality is that it\u0027s awful, something is definitely wrong, too much pandering to big business (as with everything in the US) and not giving a rats about your fellow human being. I\u0027m guessing you\u0027re a big god botherer as well, claiming you\u0027re a \"good person\" - whatever lol.\nJames | Canberra - AUSTRALIA (wohoo)             - March 25, 2010, 10:56AM\nMaybe it\u0027s not a panacea for stuff like thumb tips Ginny but my mother was a public patient after a car crash and was treated with great care and got the treatment she needed.. When I had my back repaired fair enough it wasn\u0027t the greatest experience but it got fixed and oh boy am I grateful for what I received courtesy of the taxpayers - a wonderful standard of care from the neurosurgical team and the nursing staff who were willing to go the extra mile for me when I needed it.. They were wonderful to my husband who was there with me too and he\u0027ll say the same thing as me.. For every one bad experience there are HUNDREDS of people who experience a great level of treatment and care..\nSheridan | the hill             - March 25, 2010, 11:11AM\nShow more comments\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

Of late, I do. And it\u0027s taking a toll on my mental health.\nIt all began last week with the uproar over comedian Fiona O\u0027Loughlin\u0027s comments on Spicks and Specks suggesting Bindi Irwin was \u0027\u0027a little bit creepy\u0027\u0027. I won\u0027t go into all the arguments for and against what Fiona said - that\u0027s already been picked over - but I have noticed lately that if people want to be outraged, it\u0027s pretty easy.\nI acknowledge that being a comedian doesn\u0027t give someone the right to say anything they want, but shouldn\u0027t context be taken into account when arguing about this? Fiona is a comedian and was appearing on a comedy show. And comedy is always, and importantly, subjective.\nThings improved when a few days later I woke to an email saying: \u0027\u0027OH MY GOD, YOU MADE PEREZ!\u0027\u0027 I\u0027m fairly certain this is not a good thing. The Bindi story had gone global and had rated a mention on the celebrity gossip website of Perez Hilton.  The only bonus to come from this is that I can add to my resume: \u0027\u0027Has appeared on the same website as Lindsay Lohan\u0027s cooch.\u0027\u0027  Awesome.\nAfter dodging calls from Today Tonight and contemplating my future on the dole after the axing of Spicks, I settled in to catch up with some other news.\nPage after page of outrage confronted me.  The next hot topic: Taxpayers\u0027 money ($1.5 million) used to finance  a local TV show called Wilfred. I nearly fell off my chair.  Who knew creating local content for television costs money? What an extraordinary observation!\nWilfred is a show about a dog (who is, in fact, a man in a dog costume) and people are outraged not only because of the money it cost to produce. There\u0027s more. Someone discovered that the show contains profanity, nudity, bongs, and a rape joke. All tied up in what is essentially a love story between a dog and a cat. Now, I don\u0027t want to jump to any conclusions here, but I\u0027ve seen what my friend\u0027s chihuahua occasionally does to a cushion to let off some steam, so I\u0027d be surprised if the above adult concepts weren\u0027t included.  Oh, and it\u0027s meant to be a comedy too. That part must have been edited out of the article.\nMore outrage ensued later in the week when it \u0027\u0027emerged\u0027\u0027 that Melbourne City Council was spending money on various arts projects, one of which involved visual artists building and then demolishing brick walls. At this point, frustration had set in.  All this outrage was breeding my own.  I was becoming what I hated.  I realised this when I spent a good part of that day clicking \u0027\u0027yes\u0027\u0027 repeatedly on an online poll that asked the question, \u0027\u0027Should we be spending more on arts funding?\u0027\u0027 Clearly, I need to either take up making pet rocks or get a life.\nTo conclude the drama, enter stage left, Lady Gaga,  who is in town at the moment.  I\u0027m fairly nonplussed by her music, but I do enjoy her outfits. Particularly her occasional wearing of the lampshade over her head as a fashion statement.\nAll was going swimmingly for Gaga until some moron in Sydney took their nine-year-old daughter to her gig and was outraged by the sexy content of show, saying it was inappropriate for a younger audience. How about doing some research prior to the show?  Problem solved.\nIn absolute despair for the world in which I live, I figured, if I can\u0027t beat \u0027em, I\u0027ll join \u0027em. I can be outraged, too. So here goes â€¦\nI am outraged that sometimes KFC don\u0027t put enough salt on their chips,  that Barbecue Shapes don\u0027t have enough of that green spice on them any more and that this week I was forced to look at yet another picture of Tony Abbott in new swimming togs that revealed he does some \u0027\u0027manscaping\u0027\u0027. And that thought leaves me completely and utterly confused about life.\nOutrage. See, any idiot can do it.\nSource: The Age\nComments\n29 comments so far\nMyf,\nI saw that episode of \u0027SnS\u0027.. I have to say it was probably the most entertaining episode I have even viewed.. Patti Newton is a real trouper, Fiona O\u0027Loughlin was a hoot and you and Allan were slipping the quick qips in like someone had slipped something to both of you..\nThe two guys were excellent value and the song at the end a great finish..\nSo don\u0027t fret about the outrage... just keep them coming\nDavid | Leongatha             - March 26, 2010, 6:59AM\nI\u0027m outraged that Australians seem to have lost their sense of humour!\nBut then, what can you expect when the hoi polloi apparently rate Shannon Noll performing \"What About Me\" as the best thing since sliced bread in a wheat field. Someone who can\u0027t sing whinging about not getting enough attention? How can this be?!!\nAnd by the way, Spicks \u0026 Specks was great - hardly been a dud episode yet.\nMerri - March 26, 2010, 8:04AM\nMyf,\nWe also watched that particular show and almost wet the leather lounge with laughter. For safety reasons we will be covering the lounge with a mackintosh before watching \u0027Sn\u0027s episodes!\nLove it , Artyfarty.\nartyfarty | lake macquarie             - March 26, 2010, 8:04AM\nMyf - unfortunately there are always going to be people who get outraged over trivia. So much easier than getting outraged over real things, like climate change, poverty, Aboriginal health, etc, etc. As they say in the classics \"don\u0027t let the turkeys get you down\"!\nMegaKay | Sydney             - March 26, 2010, 7:52AM\nI agree. Great show as ever. My daughter loves Bindi, but, well I tend to agree with Ms O\u0027Loughlin. Had no idea the quip had caused such consternation.Keep it up!\nBemused | Clovelly             - March 26, 2010, 7:25AM\nI don\u0027t know why it is, but some people love to be outraged. This is why people like Alan Jones can be so successful - they know how to press the buttons of this audience in order to elicit an emotional response, and outrage is a pretty easy one to get. I don\u0027t know why there are so many people who are not happy unless they have something (usually quite unimportant) to get their knickers in a knot about, but there are. Maybe because passing judgement on others is such fun?\nHC - March 26, 2010, 8:12AM\nI agree with David, that episode was hilarious. Great article Myf, love your work!\nGreg | Sydney             - March 26, 2010, 8:23AM\nYou know what Myf..?\nNo-one will EVER be outraged about you...\nYou are gorgeous :-) xxx\nPhil | Central Vic             - March 26, 2010, 8:33AM\nI\u0027m with you, Myf. I\u0027ve posted many times saying that there is too much outrage today. Instead of being \"miffed\", (sic), \"askance\", \"concerned\", \"upset\" or \"unhappy\" with or about something, it seems as though everyone is OUTRAGED. I blame the media for publishing such ridiculous cr@p and for the modern phenomenon of \"me, me, me\".\nbtw, you are still hot even at the checkout at Coles.\nPersona Non Grata | Port Melbourne             - March 26, 2010, 8:33AM\nWell said Myf. hmmmm.....I also find myself becoming somewhat outraged with all the outrage these days. Keep fighting it though. Constant whingers! Who really wants to be like them?\nOKFJ - March 26, 2010, 8:33AM\nShow more comments\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

If you have a folder like this, tell no one.\nAccording to a 2008 Columbia University statistical study, most of us have a \"personal network\" of about 610 people: 640 for men and 590 for women.\nFactoring in gossip, it takes only one friend, acquaintance, neighbour or colleague to know of that folder\u0027s existence for everyone to ask about the book\u0027s progress until it is published, reviewed and available in bookshops, preferably in the window. Death often comes first.\nUnless you\u0027re a late starter, 610 people you encounter occasionally at parties, work functions and especially at literary events will stop, furrow their brows and ask: \"So, how\u0027s the book going?\"\nActually, if the Columbia statisticians had refined their study they might have identified an inverse relationship between the degree of acquaintance and the likelihood of being asked that question.\nPartners, close friends and immediate family don\u0027t ask. They know how hard it is to maintain that interested, sympathetic, gently smiling expression once you get going, especially if it\u0027s in a restaurant with no easy escape and another bottle of wine - \"Oh, is that one gone already? We were talking so much, I didn\u0027t notice\" - on its way.\nIt\u0027s the people towards the periphery of your network who ask - friends you still see once a year at Christmas, colleagues from two or three jobs ago, neighbours from your old street.\nFirst time round, the answer trips off your tongue. \"Oh, I\u0027ve written \u0027x\u0027 number of words, can\u0027t wait to get to the computer each day, the first draft\u0027s almost finished.\" Then it\u0027s the second draft, then the third.\nThen, like any good story, there\u0027s an obstacle. \"I have to do more research.\" \"I\u0027m just waiting to find out whether I\u0027ve got the grant.\" \"The grant? Oh, I came really close but just missed out.\"\nFinally, you realise \"So, how\u0027s the book going?\" is a conversational fall-back. People simply can\u0027t recall your partner\u0027s name, your current job, whether you\u0027ve been anywhere exotic recently or if you have kids, a dog or a cat.\nSo, don\u0027t tell them about that folder. If you do, it\u0027s the one thing they\u0027ll remember.\nJill Dimond\nHeckler\nSydney Morning Herald daily guest columnist\nMore Heckler articles\nJoin the conversation\n3 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 245 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 237 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 134 people read this\nAll this outrage is outrageous 30 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 118 people read this\nTop National Times articles\nKicking a dying man - a tale of US \u0027care\u0027\nA worm to make you squirm\nKeneally\u0027s challenge: turning vibes into votes\nIn the Billinudgel\u0027s front bar there\u0027s no reason to bother\nOur law enforcers must be blind to race\nMore National Times articles\nSociety \u0026 Culture Topics\nArtsExpand (1496)\nAll Arts (1496)\nAustralian (655)\nWriter (303)\nHistory (267)\nModern (221)\nThe Age (195)\nDirector (181)\nFilm (175)\nAuthor (164)\nBritish (164)\nMusic (147)\nBooks (143)\nEnglish (127)\nLanguage (113)\nFrench (92)\nVideo (89)\nBeer (85)\nMovies (81)\nFashion (79)\nFestival (76)\nQueensland (71)\nMore Arts\nScience \u0026 HealthExpand (1389)\nAll Science \u0026 Health (1389)\nHealth (265)\nResearch (239)\nBody (193)\nHeart (189)\nSpace (153)\nEnvironment (142)\nTechnology (135)\nScience (122)\nClimate change (115)\nCold (105)\nResources (105)\nBrain (101)\nEnergy (99)\nAlcohol (96)\nComputer (94)\nCancer (86)\nAlternative (81)\nCarbon (75)\nExercise (75)\nDrugs (73)\nBirth (72)\nMore Science \u0026 Health\nMedia \u0026 AdvertisingExpand (1319)\nAll Media \u0026 Advertising (1319)\nTV (201)\nThe Age (195)\nInternet (147)\nDrive (126)\nHerald (122)\nAudience (119)\nRadio (107)\nThe Word (100)\nABC (95)\nEntertainment (88)\nAdvertising (87)\nMarketing (84)\nCelebrity (72)\nCreative (72)\nMore Media \u0026 Advertising\nUrban AffairsExpand (1308)\nAll Urban Affairs (1308)\nHealth (265)\nEducation (193)\nPolice (177)\nSchools (126)\nCrime (122)\nClimate Change (115)\nTransport (106)\nEnergy (99)\nReligion (84)\nMarriage (76)\nChina (73)\nTax (73)\nCelebrity (72)\nHousing (70)\nMore Urban Affairs\nEducationExpand (1274)\nAll Education (1274)\nHistory (267)\nArt (179)\nViolence (156)\nGroups (151)\nMusic (147)\nEnvironment (142)\nEnglish (127)\nScience (122)\nSport (114)\nFunding (107)\nTransport (106)\nDrugs (73)\nMore Education\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nThe Goanna\nMaybe at this election we should just toss a coin?\nBella Counihan: Politics is all about the punt, the gamble, the odds, the numbers.

The estimated delivery date put the baby firmly in the Gemini camp (mischievous, multi-dimensionally talented, often involved in international financial wheeling and dealing). However, towards the end of the pregnancy, the hospital began talking about inducing the birth early â€“ and in the Taurian zodiac. Was my daughter\u0027s personality about to take an abrupt u-turn? I wasn\u0027t so sure I like the sound of a Taurus baby as much, as they were \"often regarded as snobby, withdrawn, boring or even sulky\". What had happened my curious, talkative child with a special interest in foreign languages?\nThere is a case before the Bombay High Court at the moment seeking a ban on astrology, along with a host of other new age practices such as reiki, feng shui, tarot and palmistry, on the basis that they are not science. Here in Australia, it is staggering to see how sympathetic we still are towards new age fluff such as horoscopes.  Are people really so gullible and desperate for direction that they consult these vague, boring predictions that were declared back in 1975 by 186 leading astronomers and physicists (including 18 Nobel prize winners) as having \"no verified scientific basis\"?\nOut of curiosity, I decided to compile various horoscope readings on a single day from a range of media sites to see if there was any internal consistency to astrological readings. The inconsistencies were laugh-out-loud silly.\nAmong the predictions for Sagittarians (my star sign), \"Something . . . is making you feel a little sad or disenchanted\"; conversely another announced a \"positive and optimistic backdrop to your day\". One source claimed \"your mind is on far away places today, making it hard for you to get much work done\" while another declared that \"the day will pass by quickly and you should be able to accomplish much\". My \"beneficial colours\" were a near-rainbow: olive green and khaki in one source, sapphire blue in another, and purple by a third. Other more curious advice cautioned me to be \"very careful to avoid secret relationships\" and mourning the return of a loaned item \"that gave you a slightly better lifestyle\".\nOf course, such a simple experiment will do nothing to silence the believers. They will claim that some astrologers are more accurate than others. My question then is: Which ones?\nThe \"science\" by which astrologers claim that celestial bodies somehow influence our personalities and behaviours has been shot to pieces by people with more experience in physics and astronomy than you or I. That the moon exerts a far greater gravitational effect on the Earth than the planets, and the sun wields a much larger electromagnetic effect are incontrovertible facts conveniently ignored by astrologers. That carefully controlled studies of individuals born at the exact same time and location have shown no similarities at all in terms of personality or destiny is somehow seen as proof that skeptics are just killjoys out to ruin everyone else\u0027s good time. That we have since realised that the sun passes through not 12 constellations but at least 13 and maybe as many as 24, well that\u0027s just being pedantic.\nYeah, yeah, science might not have all the answers (yet) but think of it this way: not one properly controlled study of astrology has ever shown a level of accuracy above what might usually be attributed to chance.\nSo rather than concentrate on the bad science behind astrology or the various idiosyncrasies of the human mind that lead us to look for collaborative evidence while overlooking conflicting facts, perhaps we should be looking at the question of harm. Does it matter if people consult horoscopes? Isn\u0027t it all just a bit of fun?\nApart from the fact that astrology diminishes the awe with which we should regard our universe, it diverts our attention (and our money) away from more legitimate and worthwhile goals. Humans have a unique capacity for reason and rational thought. We are capable of rising above the superstitious to think clearly and critically about life and the world around us.\nNew age beliefs such as astrology revel in their traditional roots, claiming that the fact that they are based on age-old practices, passed down through the generations, should somehow be a cause for celebration. When astrology is criticised or proven wrong, believers become the sulky child in the corner of the room with their eyes shut and their fingers in their ears, bemoaning how unfair and mean its critics are. Science, on the other hand, has inbuilt mechanisms for weeding out incorrect assumptions; in fact, what is proven incorrect is just as important as what is shown to be correct â€“ it\u0027s called progressing our understanding of the world. Astrology cheapens the valuable and amazing advances made through science and promotes uncritical thinking.\nWe don\u0027t need to show tolerance toward views and practices that are fundamentally silly and an insult to our collective intelligence. When we allow new age beliefs begrudging acceptance and give them air time and column space, we create a kind of tacit support and an environment where irrational and dangerous ideas can survive and even prosper.\nEnough is enough. It\u0027s time for the sensible, the intelligent and the rational-minded to stand up and put an end to this new age of stupidity â€” starting with horoscopes. But then I would say that, wouldn\u0027t I? Sagittarians are always bloody so cynical.\nSarah McKenzie is a freelance writer.\nSource: theage.com.au\nComments\n4 comments so far\nI\u0027ve always (well, since a young age anyway) wondered how people manage to believe in astrology. I mean, it\u0027s worse than climate change scepticism isn\u0027t it? At least with the latter you can claim that there is some uncertainty and \"the science is too hard to understand\".\nWhen it comes to astrology, the only science needed is good old-fashioned Newtonian gravity. The stars, the planets, the moons and asteroids, every grain of dust all move in a fashion that can be described by simple maths. Of course, with multiple forces acting on a moving body its motion can be difficult to predict but that\u0027s due to the complexity of the maths, not because it\u0027s completely beyond science. In theory, given enough information about the positions and vectors of the local celestial bodies as they were a billion years ago you would be able to map their positions practically forever (or until the sun expands and changes the landscape).\nWhich leaves the whole concept of \"free will\" looking a little shaky doesn\u0027t it? It turns the universe into a big puppet show, with history mapped out in its entirety back at the big bang, with the rest just going through the clockwork motions.\nDo the laws of physics change when a condom breaks (whoops, Mars just skipped back in its orbit) or was the week spot in the rubber predestined?\nRay - March 26, 2010, 7:25AM\nThe stupid, and those who would make a buck from them, are ever with us; the question is how do you protect the willfully stupid from themselves.\nI have known a number of astrology enthusiasts, and I have observed that though they love all the \"reading the horoscope\" and \"casting the horoscope\" stuff, very few actually allow it to direct their behaviour, some sort of commonsense gene seems to kick in and they forget about it until the next magazine or \"psychic\" session.\nHere in Qld. we have TV commercials for \"Psychic Fairs\" ... just a few seconds listening to and looking at the poor souls being used to promote the event tells you all you need to know, and how futile it would be to try to bring them to some understanding of their delusional state.\nOverall, religious rip-off charlatans in cults and\"charismatic\" churches, (or mainstream ones for that matter), seem to do more harm.\nBill C. | Qld.             - March 26, 2010, 7:24AM\nReplace the word \u0027astrology\u0027 with \u0027religion\u0027 and the article loses none of its power! It seems most people are capable of astonishing and prolonged acts of self-delusion.\nJK | Canberra             - March 26, 2010, 8:49AM\nI concur. Maybe Fairfax papers could take the lead, and cease giving these pseudo-sciences validation via the simple agency of not publ;ishing horoscopes, articles lauding feng shui, reiki, and other new age fluff, and ceasing to give any religion without empirical evidence for the existence of its imaginary friends any creedence. Balancing this with publishing more science articles, articles encouraging critical thinking and debunking the fallacies so beloved by the gullible would increase the news organisation\u0027s reputation as an objective and informative source.\nFurious Ennui - March 26, 2010, 9:09AM\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

This is particularly important in Australia where China and India have moved up the ranks quickly as leading export destinations for Australia.\nIn cricket terminology, Australia\u0027s exports to China have been growing steadily and consistently over a reasonable period of time, like a test match innings, while exports to India have shot up quickly like a 20/20 game. But with all the attention on China and India, there\u0027s been a third force to be reckoned with â€“ ASEAN â€“ the Association of South East Asian Nations.\nThe local neighbourhood to our near north is becoming an important economic region to Australia, accounting for 10 per cent of our trade. Almost 45 per cent of Australia\u0027s 44,000 strong exporter community sell goods alone to the ASEAN market. Furthermore, ASEAN is becoming important for small business too, with 21 per cent of exporting small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) now selling into the region. They used to talk about Australiaâ€™s \u0027\u0027tyranny of distance\u0027\u0027 from the rest of the world, well now we can talk about the \u0027\u0027power of proximity\u0027\u0027 with ASEAN joining China and India, as well as our traditional North-East Asian markets of Japan and Korea and the like. At a time when this period has been dubbed \u0027\u0027The Asia Pacific century\u0027\u0027, Australia finds itself the right place at the right time.\nÂ \nIn fact, there\u0027s going to be even more action in the neighbourhood, as there\u0027s a new trade agreement - the ASEAN, Australia, New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) that was negotiated by Trade Minister Simon Crean and came into force at the beginning of the year. The AANZFTA agreement links the 12 nations of ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand into a trade community of 600 million people with a combined GDP of $A3.1 trillion. AANZFTA is Australiaâ€™s most comprehensive agreement and given that it covers 12 nations it took considerable skill to negotiate. It follows on from agreements that Australia has with Chile, the US, Singapore, Thailand and New Zealand, with a further nine on the table for negotiation and/or consideration including potential pacts with China, Japan, Korea and the Pacific island nations. Those deals coupled, with the Doha Round in the WTO, APEC and the G20 means a gruelling schedule is ahead of the Trade Minister, who will draw on all his negotiating skills and experience as ACTU president and general secretary of the Federated Storeman and Packers Union.\nÂ \nWhat measures are in AANZFTA? The pact will immediately reduce tariffs to a range of agricultural exports, such as wheat and lamb to the Philippines, and cheese and grapes to Malaysia. In fact, by 2020, 96 per cent of all tariffs on current Australian exports to ASEAN are expected to be removed under AANZFTA. Australian exporters of dairy, horticulture, metals and automotive components are some of the key winners in the deal.\nÂ \nHowever, that\u0027s just the trade side. Australia\u0027s ties to ASEAN are increasingly in the investment column as well. Accordingly, AANZFTA also includes measures covering issues important to investors such as intellectual property, e-commerce, business travel, competition policy and capacity building. This will help investment both ways, as ASEAN itself looks to invest in Australia too. These measures are timely because we\u0027ve seen a shift in economic momentum to the Asia Pacific region, particularly in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (GFC), which has had an influence on Australia\u0027s sources of foreign direct investment (FDI). For example, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) inward FDI stock from ASEAN grew 109 per cent from 2003-2008 compared with 52.6 per cent growth from the European Union during the same period, so ASEAN will increasingly be a player in the investment space in Australia.\nÂ \nThere are strong signs now that ASEAN is joining China and India as a major economic partner for Australia and with the opportunities that will abound in AANZFTA, there will be even more reasons for Australian exporters and investors to \u0027\u0027love thy neighbour\u0027\u0027.\nÂ \nÂ \nTim Harcourt is chief economist with the Australian Trade Commission.( www.austrade.gov.au/economistscorner )\nComments\nBe the first to comment.\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

But the Queenslander has already shown he can do almost as much damage to Abbott from the inside as he did to Malcolm Turnbull from the outside.\nComments 17\nKeneally\u0027s challenge: turning vibes into votes\nANNE SUMMERS\nIs it just the charm before the storm, Anne Summers wonders, or can the Labor leader stave off her party\u0027s looming defeat?\nComments 15\nTamil asylum seekers still need protection\nDAVID FEITH\n6:35am\nI was disturbed to read recently that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is considering changing its international protection guidelines for Sri Lankan and Afghan asylum seekers. The Australian government, predictably, was quick to state that any change to the UNHCR guidelines would allow Australia to send Tamil and Afghan asylum seekers back to their home countries. The motivation of the Australian government is quite transparent â€“ in an election year, the issue of asylum seekers is a potential political minefield for the government (unlike the asylum seekers, who if returned to their home countries could face literal minefields). This stems from the government trying to compete with the opposition on who could be tougher with border protection, rather than educating the Australian public as to the \"push factors\" behind desperate Tamils risking their lives to escape brutal suppression and atrocities committed by the Sri Lankan government.\nComments 0\nOur law enforcers must be blind to race\nSUSHI DAS\n3:59pm\nHow many times have you heard people say: Australia is not a racist country. Presumably they mean racism is not enshrined in Australian law (as it once was) and that racism is not widely practised.

Grace, is supposed to have said about the toss of the coin: â€œWhen you win the toss, usually you bat. If you are in doubt, you think about it, and then bat.â€ Tony Abbottâ€™s more a road-racer, pugilist and rugby rouser than a student of the carefully crafted game of cricket, of course. And so, when Abbottâ€™s side won the toss yesterday,  Grace was ignored and Kevin Rudd was sent in to bat.\nComments 2\nIntegrity flourishes in openness\nROSS GITTINS\nWhen you spend as much time as I do monitoring the words and actions of politicians, it\u0027s easy to become cynical and lapse into the belief that the world\u0027s a pretty phoney place.

The estimated delivery date put the baby firmly in the Gemini camp (mischievous, multi-dimensionally talented, often involved in international financial wheeling and dealing). However, towards the end of the pregnancy, the hospital began talking about inducing the birth early â€“ and in the Taurian zodiac. Was my daughter\u0027s personality about to take an abrupt u-turn? I wasn\u0027t so sure I like the sound of a Taurus baby as much, as they were \"often regarded as snobby, withdrawn, boring or even sulky\".

If you are an aspiring first home buyer, rising house prices raise the bar and put home ownership out of reach. If you are upgrading to a better home, rising house prices widen the gap between what you get and what you pay.\nComments 132\nSo busy taking pictures for posterity, we miss the magic of the moment\nSUZY FREEMAN-GREENE\nSadly, camera phones have made it even easier to look at life through a lens.\nComments 6\nTime for the Church to focus on the victims\nCATHY KEZELMAN\nThe Pope\u0027s letter to 15,000 victims of Irish clergy abuse, while expressing his shame and remorse along similar lines to his apology in Australia and US in 2008, falls well short of the mark. While it rebukes Irish bishops and lower ranking officials it makes no mention of any sanctions against them over their \"grave errors of judgment\" in not responding to sex abuse allegations. He suggests that the church\u0027s own laws, properly applied, should lead to the expulsion of clergy who sexually abuse children.  However, the scale of this scandal would suggest otherwise. The church is facing a burgeoning crisis in countries all over Europe, including in the Pope\u0027s native Germany and most recently in Brazil.\nComments 27\nConfessions of a compulsive reader\nBIBI VAN DER ZEE\nGoing to the loo without a book!

But maybe if we focus so much on which horse crosses the finishing line first, politics could look as silly as a man sporting a pair of c-cups.\nComments 3\nPeter Hartcher\nAbbott was the north wind and Rudd was the sun\nIN THE Aesop\u0027s fable where the north wind challenges the sun to a test of strength, the wind uses all its bluster to rip the cloak from a passing traveller.\nComments 40\nMichelle Grattan\nA quick hit, or it would get ugly\nAn early reshuffle may have saved Abbott days of uncertainty at the hands of a resurgent Turnbull and defensive Joyce.\nComments 7\nKatharine Murphy\nWhen Benjamin Button went to Canberra\nHow did they all get older so suddenly, I wondered as I scanned the government\u0027s frontbench from my usual vantage point in Parliament House? It\u0027s only February. Most of these ministers got a reasonable break at Christmas, by Rudd government standards.\nMiranda Devine\nA worm to make you squirm\nThe worm is a moron. The Channel Nine host Tracy Grimshaw ought to apply an IQ test to her audience of \"undecided\" voters before she gives them a licence to press buttons.\nComments 179\nRoss Gittins\nIntegrity flourishes in openness\nWhen you spend as much time as I do monitoring the words and actions of politicians, it\u0027s easy to become cynical and lapse into the belief that the world\u0027s a pretty phoney place. So it\u0027s nice to be reminded there\u0027s actually a lot of integrity in the world. Indeed, the economy is built on it. And it\u0027s made a major contribution to our prosperity.\nComments 24\nJessica Irvine\nGrowth is good but fattening\nAh, the end of another working week. Soon, it will be time to knock off, crack open a bottle of wine and begin erasing memories of the week that was. Personally, I will be trying to get back the hour I spent watching Kevin Rudd\u0027s glued-on grin and listening to Tony Abbott\u0027s fake laugh. Aren\u0027t we glad that\u0027s over?\nComments 3\nAnnabel Crabb\nArt of the poisoned pen\nSamuel Johnson, Charles Dickens, Matthew Parris and Matt Price added to the democratic tradition by lampooning elected representatives of the people. Annabel Crabb explains the dangerous craft of the political sketch writer.\nComments 35\nStephanie Peatling\nDeal proves Senate is not always a dead end\nGetting the youth allowance changes passed shows the government and opposition can work together, sometimes.\nShaun Carney\nDebate entangles Abbott\nWithout a policy to present, the Liberal leader had to resort mostly to criticism.\nComments 21\nMarian Wilkinson\nFlicker of optimism as leaders fly in\nCOPENHAGEN: A \u0027\u0027heroic\u0027\u0027 effort will be needed to get a deal done on climate change by tomorrow, negotiators said.\nPaul Sheehan\nPartisan politics and secrets in Obama\u0027s health deal\nPresident Obama has delivered one of the most partisan pieces of major legislation, delivered by one the most partisan processes, in the last 100 years.\nComments 42\nPhillip Coorey\nSafety warning: debate fireworks could explode in somebody\u0027s face\nTony Abbott\u0027s first parliamentary question as leader was to challenge Kevin Rudd\u0027s intestinal fortitude.\nComments 49\nMike Carlton\nHeaven\u0027s above, this po-faced cynic gives atheism a bad name\nThe trouble with Richard Dawkins, the famous atheist, is that he has no sense of humour. Or if he does, if there is some elfin gaiety within, it has lost the struggle to get out.\nDaniel Flitton\nMore arrivals inevitable\nPeople smugglers might take advantage, but we have a responsibility to refugees.\nComments 37\nAndrew Clennell\nKeneally is just a different jockey on the same horse\nLabor\u0027s general secretary Matt Thistlethwaite is said to have told MPs earlier this month that the party, at its current standing, risked winning just 16 to 20 seats at the next election, down from its current 52. The indications are it doesn\u0027t matter who leads the party, this sort of annihilation is on the way.\nComments 35\nCynthia Banham\nUS looks in our direction for wisdom on drought\nA few hours out of San Diego, taking the scenic route along Highway 1 to San Francisco, I spotted a large creature by the roadside. We turned the car around and joined a few people taking a closer look. Lolling on the grass, like a beautiful giant slug, was an elephant seal.\nComments 9\nPaul Austin\nAnti-Labor swings put the spotlight on Brumby\u0027s chances\nState Labor has peaked, so how far has the tide run out in Victoria?\nComments 26\nCatherine Deveny\nHey Hey it\u0027s history\nTurn Channel Nine into a television museum? It\u0027s one already, Daryl.\nComments 36\nAnne Davies\nAn Iraq-style \u0027surge\u0027 - or another Vietnam?\nAfghanistan is not another Vietnam, President Barack Obama declared just a few minutes after announcing that the US would send another 30,000 troops.\nComments 3\nPaola Totaro\nHistory hoons ransack Europe\u0027s heritage\nWho is killing the great monuments of Europe? Stupid, selfish tourists, actually.\nPaul Daley\nThe drinks should be on Rudd\nIf our PM shouts the US President he may find out why, despite a slump in Obama\u0027s popularity, people still want to have a beer with him.\nAndrew Frost\nCultural ganglands alive and kicking\nWhat\u0027s wrong with the young people of today? They have too much time on their hands. Things are too easy. No one is interested in creating culture. And they\u0027re ignorant of history. Blame Facebook, YouTube and Wikipedia.\nComments 19\nTony Wright\nThe benefits of a predecessor\u0027s fury\nIf leaders build voter support as much upon who they are not as who they are, then Paul Keating\u0027s savaging of Tony Abbott this week did the Opposition Leader a favour.\nAndrew Darby\nOutfoxing the foxes: A pesky question\nAustralia\u0027s most destructive feral predator, the fox, first stepped aboard the country\u0027s marsupial ark, Tasmania, in 1998.\nComments 16\nKenneth Davidson\nWe\u0027ve nothing to gain from US trade deal\nIt is not in Australia\u0027s interests to submit toqla NAFTA-style pact.\nComments 23\nTim Colebatch\nHousing at these prices will leave us all a heavy debt to bear\nAverage buyers can\u0027t compete with rich, tax-subsidised investors. If you are an aspiring first home buyer, rising house prices raise the bar and put home ownership out of reach. If you are upgrading to a better home, rising house prices widen the gap between what you get and what you pay.\nComments 132\nDanny Katz\nSt Kilda Road is a pain in the neck\nContortions fail to flatter the menthol stinky writer in a support bra, one knee raised.\nComments 6\nCosima Marriner\nBligh hoping past stumbles are a distant memory\nIt\u0027s been 10 months since the last election but the Liberal National Party has yet to produce any policies, content to simply score easy political points in Bligh\u0027s annus horribilis. But Bligh\u0027s fortunes are likely to hinge on how the Queensland economy performs this year.\nComments 3\nMelissa Fyfe\nFew happy as voters\u0027 eyes turn to water works\nThe Premier\u0027s Great Big Water Adventure may be heading for a sticky ending.\nComments 3\nChris Berg\nFollow the leader\nWithout a firm grasp of ideology, Coalition politicians have no way of making coherent policies.\nComments 2\nLindy Edwards\nThe self-proclaimed heir can\u0027t recapture Howard\u0027s appeal\nTony Abbott looks to have made his version of John McCain\u0027s \"Sarah Palin blunder\", but that is not his greatest challenge as he endeavours to create a new conservative party. McCain made a fatal blunder in the US presidential election when he appointed Palin as his running mate. At first blush the decision was heralded as a strategic masterstroke as she could energise the party\u0027s base.\nComments 18\nCharles Waterstreet\nIn the Cross fire\nThe great world powers would learn from local criminal groups about how to deal with brutally enforced occupation of land by gun-laden heavies and the subtle and sometimes savage negotiations and killings needed to move that group out and replace them with muscled-up rightful owners of the turf.\nGeoff Strong\nMade in Australia rebadging hides more than it shows\nA label once displayed with pride seems to be losing all meaning.\nComments 38\nElizabeth Farrelly\nHoney, I coached the kid: curse of the pushy parent\nNow it\u0027s over we can say it: coaching kids is like drugs in sport. Just as most serious athletes believe most of their peers take performance-enhancing drugs, most kids who make the selective schools take performance-enhancing tuition.\nComments 80\nRichard Ackland\nThe right to know, only what it wants\nI wondered why Australia\u0027s Right to Know Campaign had gone a bit quiet. This is the outfit driven by the main newspaper groups (including Fairfax) and broadcasters to lobby for fewer legal impediments that get in the way of reporters\u0027 access to information.\nComments 2\nLisa Carty\nWe need a rational debate on MPs\u0027 pay\nIt\u0027s a tough job but someone has to do it, so maybe politicians\u0027 salaries should reflect that.\nComments 4\nSarah Wilson\nAs flimsy as a philanderer\u0027s promise\nThis week I ... learn to commit. With a wedding.*\nChalpat Sonti\nGo forth and sledge - if you know what\u0027s good for you\n11:24am\nWhatever happened to trying to win by verballing?\nJosh Gordon\nAbbott Show needs less clowning, more action\nThe Opposition Leader is good at getting attention, but that may not be enough.\nComments 3\nTanveer Ahmed\nDoctor, doctor, give me the nurse\nThe Rudd government\u0027s plan for an extra $600 million to train hundreds of GPs and specialists raises the broader question of whether having more doctors will give us better, more efficient healthcare.\nComments 22\nHamish McDonald\nTrue friends must tell the truth\nThe coolness didn\u0027t last long. Along with standing firm on \u0027\u0027border security\u0027\u0027 and opposing higher taxes, our politicians find it hard to maintain any indignation, let alone anger or rage, against Israel.\nJason Koutsoukis\nUnneighbourly neighbour spooks a region\nDuring a visit to the Persian Gulf this week to drum up support for harsher sanctions against Iran, Hillary Clinton outlined three options facing the Arab states.\nJim Schembri\nSome major retailers are digging a ditch for themselves\nFor the future\u0027s sake, big change over small change is needed.\nAdele Horin\nWhy a gender quota is the only solution to board imbalance\nAside from \u0027\u0027tax\u0027\u0027, the word most likely to send the business community into a frenzy of resistance is \u0027\u0027quota\u0027\u0027, especially when coupled with the word \u0027\u0027women\u0027\u0027.\nGeorge Williams\nThe moral quandary of sterilising a child\nA recent Family Court decision permitting the sterilisation of an 11-year-old girl with a severe disability presents a legal and moral quandary. It is easy to understand the outrage of people who are alarmed and horrified that disabled children are still being sterilised. But Angela (a pseudonym) will only undergo the procedure after an independent judge found it to be in her best interests. In the end, her welfare must be paramount.\nComments 29\nRichard Glover\nThe Lara Bingle of climate change\nDo climate-change sceptics have the same attitude to other pieces of expert advice? When their car develops a fault and the local  mechanic says the brake pads are shot, do they seek a second opinion? And having been told by the second mechanic that, yes, the brake pads are shot, do they then trawl around town until on the 99th visit, they strike a mechanic who says â€œno, the brake pads are fineâ€? And then driving at high speed up the F3, do they  entrust their lives to this last opinion?\nGerard Henderson\nHigh jobless youth numbers fit under the health umbrella, too\nKevin Rudd challenged Tony Abbott to a debate on health at the National Press Club today, the invitation was accepted and no fewer than 11 journalists decided to join in.\nComments 21\nLisa Pryor\nStand by your man, but please don\u0027t pretend he\u0027s Mr Perfect\nRemember Mere Male? For many decades pithy tales of masculine hopelessness, sent in by readers, were a women\u0027s magazine institution. Light-hearted stories of domestic ineptitude - husbands mistaking bleach for laundry liquid, fathers serving babies chocolate crackles for dinner - took pride of place alongside recipes for oriental-style mince.\nPeter Costello\nRudd, Abbott in wacky race to the bottom of the tax barrel\nIt doesn\u0027t matter whose policy\u0027s bigger than whose when both are bad.\nComments 24\nHeckler\nThe question you should never ask\n\"SO, HOW\u0027S the book going?\"\nAuthorExpand\nHeckler (142)\nMichelle Grattan (109)\nPeter Hartcher (107)\nThe Goanna (101)\nMiranda Devine (77)\nAnnabel Crabb (76)\nPaul Sheehan (64)\nElizabeth Farrelly (54)\nCharles Waterstreet (53)\nPhillip Coorey (50)\nRichard Glover (47)\nGerard Henderson (47)\nShaun Carney (45)\nRichard Ackland (45)\nRoss Gittins (45)\nSimon Webster (43)\nAdele Horin (42)\nPaul Daley (41)\nChris Henning (40)\nDavid Dale (39)\nPeter Costello (38)\nHamish Mcdonald (33)\nLisa Pryor (32)\nLeslie Cannold (31)\nGeorge Williams (30)\nPaul Austin (30)\nJessica Irvine (29)\nRick Feneley (27)\nChalpat Sonti (27)\nWarwick Mcfadyen (25)\nTim Colebatch (25)\nTim Dick (25)\nDaniel Flitton (24)\nLisa Carty (24)\nDanny Katz (24)\nStephanie Peatling (23)\nChris Berg (23)\nCatherine Deveny (22)\nMike Carlton (21)\nMark Davis (20)\nGeoff Strong (19)\nPaola Totaro (19)\nCosima Marriner (18)\nVirginia Haussegger (18)\nJosh Gordon (17)\nMelissa Fyfe (17)\nKenneth Davidson (16)\nToni Jordan (16)\nTanveer Ahmed (16)\nLindy Edwards (15)\nAndrew Clennell (15)\nAndrew Darby (15)\nTony Wright (15)\nMyf Warhurst (14)\nAndrew Frost (14)\nJohn Passant (13)\nKatharine Murphy (13)\nAnne Davies (13)\nMichael Shmith (13)\nCbd (13)\nScott Rochfort (12)\nJason Koutsoukis (12)\nCynthia Banham (12)\nHelen Razer (11)\nDamien Murphy (11)\nJulie Szego (11)\nMichael Leunig (10)\nJen Vuk (10)\nRodney Tiffen (10)\nDamon Young (10)\nDavid Marr (10)\nRoss Cameron (10)\nJane Sullivan (10)\nKerry-anne Walsh (10)\nMatt Preston (10)\nBella Counihan (9)\nJim Schembri (9)\nMarcus Westbury (8)\nPeter Craven (8)\nBernard Lagan (8)\nJames Rose (7)\nMarian Wilkinson (7)\nNina Funnell (7)\nMalcolm Turnbull (7)\nBrigid Delaney (7)\nMatt Wade (7)\nCharles Purcell (7)\nTom Ormonde (7)\nGuy Rundle (7)\nSacha Molitorisz (7)\nMichael Coulter (7)\nJames Schloeffel (6)\nBarry O\u0027farrell (6)\nAmin Saikal (6)\nKevin Donnelly (6)\nChris Middendorp (6)\nDamien Kingsbury (6)\nTim Harcourt (6)\nMichael Fullilove (6)\nEmma Young (6)\nMore Authors\nGalleries\nJohn Spooner\nJohn Shakespeare\nAlan Moir\nRon Tandberg\nCathy Wilcox\nRocco Fazzari\nLatest Opinion\nMaybe at this election we should just toss a coin?\nBella Counihan: Politics is all about the punt, the gamble, the odds, the numbers.

The estimated delivery date put the baby firmly in the Gemini camp (mischievous, multi-dimensionally talented, often involved in international financial wheeling and dealing). However, towards the end of the pregnancy, the hospital began talking about inducing the birth early â€“ and in the Taurian zodiac. Was my daughter\u0027s personality about to take an abrupt u-turn?

While other states like Western Australia and Queensland grab the accolades for the mining boom, we forget that the NSW coal industry is booming too.\nThe Age\nCompeting visions lack a liveable balance\nThe city is at a critical point where planning must be translated into a living, breathing reality that works for Melburnians.\nSMH\nA city\u0027s constant growing pains\nTHE phrase \"Sydney planning\" is something of a contradiction in terms. But not for want of plans. The state government has just issued another one, this time a discussion paper.

His appointment was to herald the return of conviction politics. Yet, as he wrestles with the challenges of leadership, it is becoming harder to discern what Abbott really does believe in - apart from putting up a good fight.\nThe Age\nWhy the rush to ease water restrictions?\nThe crisis isn\u0027t over until dams fill and all needs are met.\nThe Age\nIt\u0027s the living who honour the fallen\nEach Anzac Day, fewer veterans and more of their descendants can be seen marching.\nThe Age\nIsrael puts its most important ally offside\nNew housing in East Jerusalem will harm the peace process.\nAll Topics\nLegal AffairsExpand (1601)\nAll Legal Affairs (1601)\nMinister (886)\nState (632)\nElection (619)\nOpposition (615)\nParliament (431)\nACT (268)\nLegislation (247)\nEvidence (241)\nSenate (236)\nDirector (192)\nParliamentary (190)\nVictoria (183)\nPolice (175)\nDefence (175)\nCabinet (164)\nMilitary (162)\nIndependent (162)\nExecutive (158)\nQueensland (149)\nPoll (145)\nDemocratic (141)\nMore Legal Affairs\nIssuesExpand (1562)\nAll Issues (1562)\nClimate Change (409)\nWar (287)\nEducation (228)\nLiberal Party (226)\nObama (220)\nTax (218)\nChina (207)\nCARE (200)\nEnergy (186)\nPolice (175)\nBudget (175)\nResources (167)\nTransport (144)\nIndia (142)\nMore Issues\nPeopleExpand (1502)\nAll People (1502)\nKevin Rudd (584)\nTony Abbott (328)\nMalcolm Turnbull (317)\nJohn Howard (253)\nBarack Obama (172)\nPeter Costello (138)\nMore People\nArtsExpand (1496)\nAll Arts (1496)\nAustralian (655)\nWriter (303)\nHistory (267)\nModern (221)\nThe Age (195)\nDirector (181)\nFilm (175)\nAuthor (164)\nBritish (164)\nMusic (147)\nBooks (143)\nMore Arts\nScience \u0026 HealthExpand (1389)\nAll Science \u0026 Health (1389)\nHealth (265)\nResearch (239)\nBody (193)\nHeart (189)\nSpace (153)\nEnvironment (142)\nMore Science \u0026 Health\nWorld AffairsExpand (1337)\nAll World Affairs (1337)\nAustralia (953)\nCanberra (278)\nChina (207)\nCopenhagen (184)\nVictoria (183)\nIndia (142)\nMore World Affairs\nMedia \u0026 AdvertisingExpand (1319)\nAll Media \u0026 Advertising (1319)\nTV (201)\nThe Age (195)\nInternet (147)\nGalleries\nJohn Spooner\nJohn Shakespeare\nAlan Moir\nRon Tandberg\nCathy Wilcox\nRocco Fazzari\nLatest Opinion\nMaybe at this election we should just toss a coin?\nBella Counihan: Politics is all about the punt, the gamble, the odds, the numbers.

I was naturally disposed to go looking for it.\u0027\u0027\nColumn 8\nTerry Honeybrook, of Ermington, believes that the best highway signs (Column 8, for days) come in pairs, and cites a brace \u0027\u0027on the side of the highway just past Nabiac.\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027Sharing in your readers\u0027 fascination with dates and tenuous connections,\u0027\u0027 writes Tom Cotton, of Hornsby, \u0027\u0027on Sunday I celebrated my father\u0027s 73rd birthday (21/3/1937).\u0027\u0027 Re-ordered, the numerals become Tom\u0027s date of birth - 13/2/1973; he\u0027s 37. \u0027\u0027Can any Column 8 readers claim something similar?\u0027\u0027 Tom asks. We would be astonished if they couldn\u0027t, Tom.\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027I have another addition for the silly-yet-appropriate place names,\u0027\u0027 writes Jerry Grimes, of South Tacoma (Column 8, for a while now). \u0027\u0027I am an expat American and was living in Harbord at the time when my parents were here on a visit.\nColumn 8\n\"Nick Flowers beat me to it with his report of the Loose Women\u0027s Institute,\" laments Julian Mallett, of O\u0027Connor, ACT (Column 8, last week). \"But I\u0027d like to inform you of another branch of that august organisation â€“ in a town near where I used to live in Essex. The town\u0027s name? Ugley.\"\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027On The 7.30 Report recently a West Australian pollie was asked about the problems of recruiting new people for the coming boom,\u0027\u0027 reports Colum Hughes, of Coogee. \u0027\u0027His reply was that they would train youth \u0027With gusto!\u0027 Who or what is Gusto, or gusto?\u0027\u0027 We are tempted to say that George Gusto runs training workshops for apprentices in the Pilbara, and maybe he does, but the word also perfectly describes the approach of Column 8 readers to life\u0027s absurdities.\nColumn 8\nTuesday\u0027s item about \u0027\u0027We\u0027re living in squalor\u0027\u0027 brought on the question \u0027\u0027Where\u0027s that?\u0027\u0027 and reminded Ann Kelly of the day when she was a girl playing in her grandmother\u0027s living room in Manildra, overhearing her two grandmothers discussing a girl who had been \u0027\u0027born out of wedlock\u0027\u0027. \u0027\u0027Where\u0027s Wedlock?\u0027\u0027 asked a curious Ann. A few moments passed before one of her grannies replied \u0027\u0027It\u0027s near Cudal\u0027\u0027.\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027Travelling north from Sydney I noticed a sign which said \u0027The Entrance Exit\u0027, writes Robert Felton, of somewhere on the road. \u0027\u0027What a nice little oxymoron. What next? \u0027Orange Peel Off\u0027, or perhaps the \u0027Ipswich Turn Off\u0027?\u0027\u0027\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027Our local Property Press recently advertised a home for sale with \u0027three robed bedrooms\u0027,\u0027\u0027 reports Hazel Mellor, of Mittagong. \u0027\u0027I wonder what disrobed bedrooms look like?\u0027\u0027 In a similar vein, Sue Bradley, of parts unknown, writes, \u0027\u0027I have been avidly following your recent physics conundra, and saw what I think to be a new example of modern physics, on a real estate sale board, in which light can be attracted to objects - similar to magnetism perhaps?\u0027\u0027 We are thrilled that Sue has adopted our plural of conundrum - decreed here some years ago to be superior to \u0027\u0027conundrums\u0027\u0027, and pass on her observation of a sign singing the praises of a \u0027\u0027Fabulous three-bedroom two-bathroom townhouse with masses of light- attracting windows and cutting-edge design.\u0027\u0027\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027The news that a live elephant has been born after having been declared dead is an example of Schrodinger\u0027s Cat (which has previously been mentioned in Column 8),\u0027\u0027 declares Natash Lee, of Alexandria.\nColumn 8\nA crossword contretemps, courtesy of Martin, who gives no surname, but Jones or Morgan would not surprise: \u0027\u0027How dare the Herald?\u0027\u0027 Martin fumes. \u0027\u0027Snowdon \u0027an English mount?\u0027 (DP\u0027s 15 across, Herald Cryptic, Wednesday). Cymru am byth!\u0027\u0027 Martin was not alone in his harrumphage. But there is much to celebrate in the cryptic this week - yesterday\u0027s puzzle was No. 19,000. That\u0027s a lot of brain pain.\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027Sky TV digital headlines continue to provide a giggle each morning,\u0027\u0027 writes Julia Archer, of North Rocks. \u0027\u0027Apparently former racing driver Stirling Moss fell down a lift well recently, and suffered broken bones and \u0027severe aberrations\u0027.\u0027\u0027\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027The cricket bat is much underrated as a murder weapon, and should be mandatory in every Australian version of Cluedo,\u0027\u0027 insists Paul Roberts, of Lake Cathie (Column 8, Tuesday). He cites the case of Jane Andrews, a former dresser of the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, who used a bat in killing her lover in 2000.\nColumn 8\nJust when we thought we\u0027d risen above the physics of plummeting (Winter Olympics sports and gravity, Column 8 for an eternity), this arrives, from \u0027\u0027Olde\u0027\u0027, of Cardiff Heights: \u0027\u0027With the discovery of ice on the moon, I am initiating a bid by potential future residents to have the 2030 Winter Olympics held there.\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027Having endured using \u0027a baseball bat\u0027 (Joe Hockey\u0027s recent \u0027Rudd\u0027s voter tax\u0027 remark), Julia Gillard\u0027s \u0027stepping up to the plate\u0027 and \u0027it came straight out of left field\u0027 comments, well, \u0027three strikes and you\u0027re out\u0027 maybe, but surely cricket bats and stumps should be the metaphors used in this country,\u0027\u0027 harrumphs a linguistically patriotic Brian Davis, of Vincentia. \u0027\u0027Does Julia know what these US sport phrases really mean? And why is a baseball bat, rather than a cricket bat, the weapon of choice for pollies and the media?\u0027\u0027 Two points here. Brian is right - as discussed here last year, we don\u0027t \u0027\u0027step up to the plate\u0027\u0027 in this country, we \u0027\u0027stride to the crease\u0027\u0027. But if you\u0027ve ever tried to beat someone to death, you\u0027ll know that a baseball bat\u0027s symmetry means that any thug can wield one - a cricket bat requires skill and dexterity for maximum impact. Hence the innate superiority of the Great Game.\nColumn 8\nMatt Bennett, of Queanbeyan, responds to Kate Clark\u0027s raised eyebrow over the \u0027\u0027pastries freshly baked in Denmark\u0027\u0027 at Sydney airport (Column 8, Friday). \u0027\u0027Watch out! They probably are baked fresh (is any bread ever baked stale? Italian bread perhaps â€¦ ) in-store daily in Denmark, then flown here. The deliciously fresh \u0027loose\u0027 pastries at the local Woolies are \u0027made in Belgium\u0027. God knows those planes must be freighting something other than flowers. Maybe it\u0027s blooms out, pastries back in.\u0027\u0027\nColumn 8\nWe threw down the girt gauntlet on Thursday (Oldest citation of \u0027\u0027girt\u0027\u0027 in English, Column 8, for centuries), and it has been enthusiastically picked up by Robert O\u0027Conner, of Kingston, ACT, who slaps us in the face with this lot: \u0027\u0027Girt by Chaucer? No problem. He uses it at least twice, including The Knight\u0027s Tale:\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027In response to Roger Pratt in his lowly Palm Beach \u0027dungeon\u0027,\u0027\u0027 responds Philip Bond \u0027\u0027late of Scotland Island\u0027\u0027 (Column 8, Tuesday), \u0027\u0027dungeon does not rhyme with dudgeon. A word that genuinely rhymes with dudgeon is gudgeon, a small fish that scavenges the bottom of streams. Used as bait by anglers for pike, the lowly gudgeon achieves a state of extreme altitude dudgeon, till the wily curmudgeon will bludgeon and swallow the gudgeon, thus terminating both gudgeon and dudgeon. Is this the last word on dudgeon?\u0027\u0027 It may well be.\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027Spotted on the side of a tub of natural yoghurt,\u0027\u0027 reports Anne Dodd, of Mosman, \u0027\u0027together with other dot point tips such as \u0027good for cooking\u0027, was the edifying advice that it is also \u0027spoonable\u0027! Who\u0027d have thought it?\u0027\u0027\nColumn 8\n\u0027\u0027Shakespeare mentions another meaning of \u0027dudgeon\u0027. On looking at the dagger he sees before him, Macbeth notes the gouts of blood on the blade and dudgeon (hilt). Could grabbing the hilt of your dagger in anger and resentment be high dudgeon? Who knows? I don\u0027t, and I was born a Dudgeon,\u0027\u0027 writes Toni McKay (nee Dudgeon), of Artarmon.\nAll Topics\nLegal AffairsExpand (1601)\nAll Legal Affairs (1601)\nMinister (886)\nState (632)\nElection (619)\nOpposition (615)\nParliament (431)\nACT (268)\nLegislation (247)\nEvidence (241)\nSenate (236)\nDirector (192)\nParliamentary (190)\nVictoria (183)\nPolice (175)\nDefence (175)\nCabinet (164)\nMilitary (162)\nIndependent (162)\nExecutive (158)\nQueensland (149)\nPoll (145)\nDemocratic (141)\nMore Legal Affairs\nIssuesExpand (1562)\nAll Issues (1562)\nClimate Change (409)\nWar (287)\nEducation (228)\nLiberal Party (226)\nObama (220)\nTax (218)\nChina (207)\nCARE (200)\nEnergy (186)\nPolice (175)\nBudget (175)\nResources (167)\nTransport (144)\nIndia (142)\nMore Issues\nPeopleExpand (1502)\nAll People (1502)\nKevin Rudd (584)\nTony Abbott (328)\nMalcolm Turnbull (317)\nJohn Howard (253)\nBarack Obama (172)\nPeter Costello (138)\nMore People\nArtsExpand (1496)\nAll Arts (1496)\nAustralian (655)\nWriter (303)\nHistory (267)\nModern (221)\nThe Age (195)\nDirector (181)\nFilm (175)\nAuthor (164)\nBritish (164)\nMusic (147)\nBooks (143)\nMore Arts\nScience \u0026 HealthExpand (1389)\nAll Science \u0026 Health (1389)\nHealth (265)\nResearch (239)\nBody (193)\nHeart (189)\nSpace (153)\nEnvironment (142)\nMore Science \u0026 Health\nWorld AffairsExpand (1337)\nAll World Affairs (1337)\nAustralia (953)\nCanberra (278)\nChina (207)\nCopenhagen (184)\nVictoria (183)\nIndia (142)\nMore World Affairs\nMedia \u0026 AdvertisingExpand (1319)\nAll Media \u0026 Advertising (1319)\nTV (201)\nThe Age (195)\nInternet (147)\nGalleries\nJohn Spooner\nJohn Shakespeare\nAlan Moir\nRon Tandberg\nCathy Wilcox\nRocco Fazzari\nLatest Opinion\nMaybe at this election we should just toss a coin?\nBella Counihan: Politics is all about the punt, the gamble, the odds, the numbers.

Yesterday, the major indices finished lower, each by a small margin.\nWhat you need to know\nThe SPI was off 2 points at 4901\nThe Australian dollar was buying 90.76 US cents\nIn the US , the S\u0026P500 was down 1.99 points at 1165.73\nIn Europe , the FTSE finished 49.77 points higher at 5727.65\nGold rose $US4.10 an ounce to $1092.90\nOil fell 8 US cents a barrel to $US80.53\nThe Reuters Jefferies CRB index was down 0.6%\nStocks to watch : possible market movers\nWhat\u0027s out today\nIn economic news, the Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens will address the ACI 2010 49th World Congress in Sydney.\nThe Australian Office of Financial Management conducts a tender for $700 million of June 2014 Treasury bonds.\nIn the news this morning\nBanks are squeezing small-business customers with higher fees and fatter margins, the Reserve Bank says, while competition between lenders has fallen.\nThe RBA also raised the prospect that tough global regulations will be watered down for Australian banks - at a time when banks are fighting for the custom of the long-ignored depositor .\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has emerged as a potential roadblock to plans by BHP and Rio to extract $US10 billion in benefits from the planned Pilbara joint venture.\nPlus, Elizabeth Knight on Gunns, Malcolm Maiden on commercial property and Fan Gang looks at the fraught question of the yuan and international currency markets.\nHow we fared yesterday\nThe Australian share market closed slightly weaker after negative overseas leads and heightened concerns over sovereign debt in Europe, and profit-takers targeted cyclical stocks.\nThe benchmark S\u0026P/ASX200 index was down 6.1 points, or 0.12 per cent, at 4885.4 points, while the broader All Ordinaries index dropped 6.9 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 4896.3 points.\nOffshore overnight\nRenewed concern about Greece\u0027s debt problems short circuited a big stock market rally on Wall Street overnight.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed with a gain of just five points after earlier rising to a new high for 2010. Broader indices ended lower.\nThe market\u0027s advance fizzled after European Central Bank\u0027s president Jean-Claude Trichet told French television that Europe must take responsibility for its financial problems. That raised concerns about when a rescue for Greece might come.\nOfficials from European nations were meeting late on Thursday to discuss their economic problems.\nInvestors have been concerned for months that problems in Greece and other debt-strapped countries in Europe would spread and spoil a global economic rebound.\nThe questions about Greece\u0027s financial situation weakened the euro and raised demand for the dollar. The climb in the dollar hit prices of commodities like energy. That, in turn, hurt shares of energy and materials stocks.\nThe worries about Greece and tepid demand at a Treasury Department bond auction for a third straight day overshadowed early enthusiasm about corporate news. Stronger earnings and a higher forecast from retailer Best Buy and a better-than-expected outlook from wireless chip maker Qualcomm lifted the market in morning trading.\nThe companies\u0027 reports raised hopes that consumer spending will increase. Higher sales of flat-panel TVs, laptop computers and smart phones are welcome signs because consumer spending is the biggest driver of the economy.\nWhen markets settled, the Dow had risen 5.06, or 0.1 per cent, at 10,841.21. The Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s 500 index fell 1.99, or 0.2 per cent, to 1165.73, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.35 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2397.41.\nEurope\u0027s main stock markets jumped as a possible joint EU-IMF rescue package to help Greece out of its spiralling debt crisis took shape during frantic negotiations in Brussels.\nLondon\u0027s benchmark FTSE 100 index rose 49.77 points, or 0.88 per cent to finish the day at 5727.65 points\nThe German Dax added 93.95 points, or 1.56 per cent, to 6132.95. The French CAC 40 rose 50.67 points, or 1.28 per cent, to 4000.48.\nCommodities\nOil prices slipped as the dollar rose against other major currencies.\nBenchmark crude for May delivery fell eight US cents to settle at $US80.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nCrude, which is priced in dollars, tends to fall in price as the greenback rises and makes oil barrels tougher to buy with foreign currency.\nOil prices initially gained after the Labor Department reported that claims for jobless benefits dropped more than expected last week, before falling back later in the day.\nMeanwhile, the futures contract for natural gas tumbled three per cent after the government reported that supplies grew for the first time this year, adding to already bloated reserves.\nApril gold futures added $US4.10 to settle at $US1092.90 per fine ounce.\nMay silver rose 10 US cents to settle at $US16.741, while May copper gained 3.5 US cents to $US3.3805 per pound.\nAAP, with BusinessDay\nJoin the conversation\n20 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nCommon Business Main Index 217 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 172 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 178 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 118 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 91 people read this\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

Google does not stop companies from buying keywords that belong to rivals as a way of diverting potential customers to their own websites - a form of brand squatting.\nLVMH had been angered by squatting by competitors - other luxury goods companies as well as wholesalers of cheaper versions - who had bought keywords for its famous brands, such as Louis Vuitton.\nThe court ruled, however, that the web giant could be held responsible if, having been told of unlawful advertiser activities, \u0027\u0027it failed to act expeditiously to remove or to disable access\u0027\u0027 to the advertising.\nThe court warned Google it could be brought to book if it did not clamp down on the trade in fake luxury goods such as designer handbags. Google may now have to monitor ads linked to searches for trademarked terms to avoid the risk of legal action.\nThat could prove a heavy workload for Google and other online companies. About half of all online searches involved brands or specific products, said Alexander Wisch, a media analyst at Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s Equity Research in London.\nAdvertisers could face more lawsuits by LVMH and other brand owners after the court ruled that advertisers who bought protected keywords for ads on search engines without identifying whose products they sold would be liable for trademark breaches.\nA leading Australian trademark lawyer said the ruling would have no binding here. \u0027\u0027This gives Google the green light,\u0027\u0027 said Katrina Rathie, a Mallesons IP partner. \u0027\u0027The court has ruled that it is not the responsibility of the search engine.\u0027\u0027\nMrs Rathie said brand owners in Australia would have two avenues to explore now the court had effectively ruled out culpability by Google. They could either take action for infringement of trademarks or for \u0027\u0027passing off\u0027\u0027, or confusing customers, which would constitute a breach of the Trade Practices Act. \u0027\u0027It\u0027s likely to lead to a lot more direct litigation by advertisers,\u0027\u0027 she said.\nHowever, she added that the Google ruling could affect the ongoing case in the Federal Court between the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and Trading Post and Google. The media regulator is suing Google and Trading Post, claiming advertising generated through Google\u0027s search engine under the heading \u0027\u0027sponsored links\u0027\u0027 was insufficiently distinguished from other search results.\nThe competition regulator took action against Google for misleading and deceptive conduct on the grounds that search-based advertisements generated for terms related to car dealers, including Kloster Ford, sent consumers to the website of Trading Post, the Telstra advertising subsidiary \u0027\u0027I think in the light of [the European] case [the presiding judge in the case] will be taking a good look,\u0027\u0027 Mrs Rathie said.\nwith Bloomberg\nJoin the conversation\n3 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 246 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 130 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 181 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 140 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 138 people read this\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

His position and that of a couple of his fellow directors, former Tasmanian premier Robin Gray and Richard Millar, have been under the microscope from governance experts, the future of Gunns\u0027 proposed pulp mill is under renewed threat and the company\u0027s earnings are under pressure.\nRating these factors in order of importance depends on where you sit. As an investor, the slump in the December half net earnings from $33.6 million to less than half a million would be of biggest concern.\nFrom an environmental perspective, the biggest issue would be whether the pulp mill in the Tamar Valley can be finally killed off.\nFor those with an eye on corporate governance the fact that Gay and some of his associates have been around for too long and have too much power is a reason to cross rather than tick the box.\nGay is a former chief executive of Gunns and became chairman in 1986. It\u0027s a fair bet none of Gay\u0027s critics were too impressed by how as chairman he sold 3.4 million shares in December - only weeks before the books were lined off on the disastrous half profit. Gay avoided paper losses of about $2 million.\nHow he is managing to retain his position as chairman is anyone\u0027s guess. Major shareholders confirmed to the Herald yesterday they had been speaking to him for more than a year about the possibility of moving on. The momentum only increased when they found out he had sold that stock.\nAt this stage it appears they have not issued him with the ultimatum to leave or he\u0027ll be voted him off at the next annual meeting or a special meeting of shareholders will be convened to achieve that outcome.\nHe has confirmed he has been approached by shareholders but is not prepared to agree to their requests. This is despite reports that some parts of the management are also behind the anti-Gay push.\nMeanwhile, all eyes this week are focused on the what may become of Gay\u0027s dreams to build the Tamar pulp mill.\nSuch was the political will to support this project under previous premier Paul Lennon that he pushed through special legislation to support it. This followed its withdrawal from the state\u0027s formal planning assessment process in 2007 after the company was unofficially advised it wouldn\u0027t meet environmental and effluent standards.\nDespite the political green light under Lennon, the mill was starved of finance when the ANZ Bank decided it was too hot from a public relations perspective. The mill\u0027s chances of getting built received a further blow last weekend when the state election delivered the balance of power to the Greens.\nIf it was to gain support from those that have lobbied so hard against it, it would do so with radical changes - undoubtedly affecting the economics of the project.\nThis series of unfortunate events has left Gunns shares languishing at 54c, nearly half its trading price last month and far lower than its September price of $1.20.\nThe trouble for its institutional supporters is that there is little incentive to sell out at these prices.\nThey see the removal of Gay as potentially a circuit-breaker that might result in a re-rating of the stock. It won\u0027t be enough.\nThe market will be waiting until April to see the results of a strategic review being undertaken by its newly appointed chief executive, Greg L\u0027Estrange.\nThere is little he can do about how the external environment has soured for Gunns with earnings from woodchips falling through the floor as demand from the Japanese plummet. And in the absence of hedging there is also nothing Gunns can do about the negative effects of the strong Australian dollar.\nIn essence, what the review trying to achieve is a break-up of the business and get some recognition of a sum-of-the-parts valuation.\nIn the first instance the proposed pulp mill would become a separately defined entity that will source its own equity and debt, thus avoiding the need to gear up the head stock any further. Gunns would retain some 40 per cent of the equity.\nThe market believes Gunns will fund its portion of the pulp mill by selling 60 per cent of its $1 billion of plantation assets. It would then use the proceeds to pay down its $661 million of debt. Operationally it would also attack its cost base by culling staff.\nAnalyst reports suggest that the potential pulp mill equity partner, Swedish firm Sodra, may invest in the plantations. But again this depends on whether the proposal ever gets the go-ahead.\nVarious reports say Gunns is close to breaching its debt covenants but as long as it is keeping up with interest payments, there is probably little its lenders will do - particularly if the restructuring plan contains some debt repayment element.\nIt\u0027s not a pretty picture down south, and regardless of financing investors should be building no blue sky into their earnings on the back of this mill being built.\nBut the believers - the ones that bought into the stock in better days - are loath to sell at these prices.\nIf this company has a bank of trees with a value of $1 billion the share price does not reflect this. Even if the value of the assets are halved the stock is still trading at a discount.\nBut then the value of the trees is a factor of what they are worth once pulped and sold to the Japanese. And at this stage the answer is unknown.\nElizabeth Knight\nMore Elizabeth Knight articles\nJoin the conversation\n3 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 161 people read this\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ... 66 people read this\nCommon Business Main Index 178 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 108 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 139 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nGunns mulls switch to sustainable woodchips\nPressure is growing on Gunns to rebuild its poor Japanese market with ...\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nGunns mulls switch to sustainable woodchips\nPressure is growing on Gunns to rebuild its poor Japanese market with sustainably certified woodchips, bringing closer an end to high-conflict old-growth logging in Tasmania.\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

They face  possible jail terms of at least five years on the bribery charge.\nHu, the head of the China iron ore business, subordinate Ge Minqiang and iron  ore salesman Wang Yong have denied the commercial secrets charge. The fourth  defendant, Liu Caiku, has not contested that charge, his lawyer Tao Wuping has  said.\nRio Tinto later said in a statement it had been  advised verdicts would be delivered on Monday but made no further comment.\n\"We\u0027ll need to see the verdict first before we decide whether or not to  appeal,\" Liu\u0027s lawyer Tao, who earlier said he had not been told when the  verdicts would be delivered, told Reuters.\nThe three-day trial, which ended on Wednesday, has also raised worries about  China\u0027s secretive legal system.\nAustralia\u0027s Mandarin-speaking Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has told China the  world is watching how it handles the case.\nAustralia asked the trial be held in open court to ensure justice, but only  the bribery charges were open to observers.\nThe trial comes at a time of increased strain between China, the world\u0027s  third-largest economy, and foreign businesses.\nOn Monday, internet giant Google Inc. \u003cGOOG.O\u003e said it would redirect  users of its mainland Chinese-language search engine to one based in Hong Kong  over a censorship and hacking row.\nBUSINESS AS USUAL\nRio, seeking to improve relations with China, had maintained since the men  were detained last July during sensitive annual iron ore price negotiations that  they had done nothing wrong.\nThe case has forced Rio, the world No. 2 iron ore producer, to examine the  way it conducts business in China. Iron ore is the main raw material in  steel-making and China is the biggest consumer of the ore.\nBut the case seems to have had little impact on Rio\u0027s operations in China,  which became its biggest customer last year, accounting for a quarter of its  sales.\nDays before the trial began, Rio Tinto signed a $2.9 billion deal with  Chinese metals group Chinalco to develop an African iron ore mine  [SGE62109U].\nRio Tinto has conducted an independent internal audit to clear itself of any  wrongdoing and determine whether there was evidence the company paid bribes to,  or received illegal payments from, Chinese steel mills, Australian media said on  Wednesday.\nReuters\nJoin the conversation\n5 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 181 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 140 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 123 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 246 people read this\nMatty Johns\u0027s new footy show rates well 49 people read this\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

And while early in the crisis bank deposits swelled by 25 per cent as customers sought safety, that growth has since slowed.\nNon-bank lenders are paying 1.40 percentage points above the bank bill rate for their funds instead of 0.15 points before the crisis. As the crisis peaked they were paying 3.80 points above bank bill rates.\nThe Reserve Bank also says we are taking out our credit cards again.\nBoth transactions and outstanding balances have picked up while we are still saving, typically putting away 4 per cent of our income compared with nothing before the crisis.\nIt believes our home borrowing is safe. Only 2 per cent of mortgage holders meet the traditional definition of \u0027\u0027stress\u0027\u0027 - payments of more than half of their after-tax income and a loan-to-valuation ratio of 90 per cent or greater.\nJoin the conversation\n12 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 153 people read this\nCommon Business Main Index 247 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 189 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 103 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 127 people read this\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

By aggregating the individual opinions of thousands of users, \u0027\u0027the crowd\u0027\u0027 determines how good or bad a company is.\nBrandkarma founder Craig Davis said the service added \"another voice in the room\" in the debate around sustainability.\n\u0027\u0027The question around the choices that we make is becoming more significant. People exercise those choices - in effect their vote - every time they buy something,\" said Mr Davis, who has worked on the project for a year and whose day job is chief creative officer at the Sydney advertising agency Publicis Mojo.\nAfter more than 20 years of creating ads for Nestle, Shell, Unilever and Ford, Mr Davis asked himself the question: \u0027\u0027What kind of world do you want to live in and leave to your kids?\u0027\u0027\nDescribed by some bloggers as a \u0027\u0027Facebook of brands\u0027\u0027, Brandkarma\u0027s mission is to \"help people help each other make better brand choices and encourage companies to be good to all their stakeholders\".\nMr Davis said he was not worried about companies rorting the system as they \u0027\u0027would eventually be found out\u0027\u0027. He said he would make money out of selling the insights gleaned from the data back to companies but would not divulge any personal information of his members.\nThe managing editor of the magazine Ethical Investor, Oliver Wagg, said Australian consumers interested in shopping sustainably had few places to turn to for information.\nA number of websites and directories had emerged to help consumers decide which \u0027\u0027green\u0027\u0027 products and services to buy, Mr Wagg said.\n\u0027\u0027But these sources generally point consumers to products and services that brand themselves as \u0027green\u0027, leaving them to carry out their own verification and, of course, open to false advertising, or \u0027greenwashing\u0027,\" he said.\nJoin the conversation\n9 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 246 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 130 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 181 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 138 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 148 people read this\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

Commonwealth Bank increased its rate by 37 basis points and ANZ by 35.\nIn February, the Reserve Bank held off on raising rates - citing banks\u0027 hefty increases as one of the reasons for staying put.\nIn the speech Mr Stevens, the RBA governor, said Australian banks had been able to secure funds by writing more home loans at the same time as global credit markets seized in the wake of the international financial crisis.\n\"When markets for securitisation closed the major banks stepped into the gap by increasing their rate of housing lending, albeit at higher prices,\" he said.\nIn this morning\u0027s broad-ranging speech, Mr Stevens said a V-shaped economic recovery - where economic activity falls sharply before recovering at a similar velocity - appeared to be underway in the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil.\nMr Stevens also noted a number of developed economies, such as the UK and US, had been increasing sovereign debt levels before the financial crisis hit.\nThe heightened risk surrounding those nations\u0027 sovereign debt could drive up the cost of credit in those markets, in turn stunting growth in the respective economies.\nczappone@fairfax.com.au\nBusinessDay\nComments\nBe the first to comment.\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

However, when Allco\u0027s share price began to fall as a result of the global financial crisis, the lenders asked for more collateral to be put up, otherwise they would seize the stock to ensure repayment of the loans.\nMr Fell told John Sheahan, SC, for the receivers, that the board would have preferred not to have made the loan given the circumstances of what had happened.\nBut it also appreciated that if APT was forced to sell the shares to meet the margin calls, then that would have been seen as a \u0027\u0027very strong vote of no confidence\u0027\u0027 in the company by the very people who set it up and were considered critical to its success.\nThe stockmarket would have interpreted that in a \u0027\u0027dire\u0027\u0027 way and in doing so would have only prompted a further sell-off in its shares which, by the time the loan was actually made in late December, had nearly halved in value from their $10.45 price in August.\nHaving hocked the shares in that manner meant that instead of them being \u0027\u0027highly liquid\u0027\u0027 assets, they were virtually the opposite, the court heard.\nMr Fell said he viewed the $50 million loan as a \u0027\u0027third line of defence\u0027\u0027 after APT and the principals were asked to put up more money and additional collateral to tackle the margin calls.\n\u0027\u0027It was a necessary evil [as it was] a strategic imperative for AFG to support APT,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nAPT later went into administration and Allco lost the money it lent to the trust.\nJoin the conversation\n3 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 138 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 181 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 123 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 140 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 246 people read this\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

Mr Coghill said the figure now was closer to 5 per cent.\n\u0027\u0027While it is well understood that QBE\u0027s US businesses have fallen short on top-line guidance for a number of years now, what is less clear is whether Praetorian, Winterthur and ZC Sterling have ultimately met QBE\u0027s stringent acquisition criteria,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nMr O\u0027Halloran expressed his desire last month to increase QBE\u0027s revenue through acquisitions, given that new business being written by many of its global competitors was at cost or unprofitable.\nQBE had $2.5 billion for acquisitions and was chasing several bolt-on acquisitions, Mr Halloran said.\nOnly 20 per cent of its net earned premium will come from its Australian operations. QBE last month reported a 6 per cent increase in annual profit, to $1.97 billion.\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 131 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 174 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 81 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 161 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 92 people read this\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

Nestle petitioned YouTube to remove the video, citing copyright infringement - Greenpeace had doctored the Kit Kat logo to read as Killer.\nWhen Nestle\u0027s company Facebook page was flooded with negative posts from \u0027\u0027unfans\u0027\u0027 the company moved to delete them and any altered logos that appeared on the social networking site.\n\u0027\u0027To repeat: we welcome your comments, but please don\u0027t post using an altered version of any of our logos as your profile pic - they will be deleted,\u0027\u0027 Nestle\u0027s moderator wrote. The company is facing a boycott of its products in the lead-up to Easter and has been forced into an about-turn.\nA day after the video was posted Nestle cancelled its contract to take palm oil directly from Sinar Mas, but to Greenpeace\u0027s disappointment it will continue to receive palm oil from the firm through its supplier Cargill.\nBelinda Fletcher, a Greenpeace campaigner, said Nestle\u0027s goals of censorship had helped fan the flames of the campaign, not douse them. \u0027\u0027We have been so amazed by how this has taken on a life of its own. It\u0027s clear it is an issue that people really care about,\u0027\u0027 she said.\nOnline and risk-and-reputation analyst SR7 said there were thousands of Australians on social media sites and more than 4000 had signed up to Nestle\u0027s Facebook site since last Friday. But almost all were saying negative things, SR7 director James Griffin said.\nSource: The Age\nJoin the conversation\n18 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 127 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 214 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 219 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 151 people read this\nCommon Business Main Index 304 people read this\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

His position and that of a couple of his fellow directors, former Tasmanian premier Robin Gray and Richard Millar, have been under the microscope from governance experts, the future of Gunns\u0027 proposed pulp mill is under renewed threat and the company\u0027s earnings are under pressure.\nRating these factors in order of importance depends on where you sit. As an investor, the slump in the December half net earnings from $33.6 million to less than half a million would be of biggest concern.\nFrom an environmental perspective, the biggest issue would be whether the pulp mill in the Tamar Valley can be finally killed off.\nFor those with an eye on corporate governance the fact that Gay and some of his associates have been around for too long and have too much power is a reason to cross rather than tick the box.\nGay is a former chief executive of Gunns and became chairman in 1986. It\u0027s a fair bet none of Gay\u0027s critics were too impressed by how as chairman he sold 3.4 million shares in December - only weeks before the books were lined off on the disastrous half profit. Gay avoided paper losses of about $2 million.\nHow he is managing to retain his position as chairman is anyone\u0027s guess. Major shareholders confirmed to the Herald yesterday they had been speaking to him for more than a year about the possibility of moving on. The momentum only increased when they found out he had sold that stock.\nAt this stage it appears they have not issued him with the ultimatum to leave or he\u0027ll be voted him off at the next annual meeting or a special meeting of shareholders will be convened to achieve that outcome.\nHe has confirmed he has been approached by shareholders but is not prepared to agree to their requests. This is despite reports that some parts of the management are also behind the anti-Gay push.\nMeanwhile, all eyes this week are focused on the what may become of Gay\u0027s dreams to build the Tamar pulp mill.\nSuch was the political will to support this project under previous premier Paul Lennon that he pushed through special legislation to support it. This followed its withdrawal from the state\u0027s formal planning assessment process in 2007 after the company was unofficially advised it wouldn\u0027t meet environmental and effluent standards.\nDespite the political green light under Lennon, the mill was starved of finance when the ANZ Bank decided it was too hot from a public relations perspective. The mill\u0027s chances of getting built received a further blow last weekend when the state election delivered the balance of power to the Greens.\nIf it was to gain support from those that have lobbied so hard against it, it would do so with radical changes - undoubtedly affecting the economics of the project.\nThis series of unfortunate events has left Gunns shares languishing at 54c, nearly half its trading price last month and far lower than its September price of $1.20.\nThe trouble for its institutional supporters is that there is little incentive to sell out at these prices.\nThey see the removal of Gay as potentially a circuit-breaker that might result in a re-rating of the stock. It won\u0027t be enough.\nThe market will be waiting until April to see the results of a strategic review being undertaken by its newly appointed chief executive, Greg L\u0027Estrange.\nThere is little he can do about how the external environment has soured for Gunns with earnings from woodchips falling through the floor as demand from the Japanese plummet. And in the absence of hedging there is also nothing Gunns can do about the negative effects of the strong Australian dollar.\nIn essence, what the review trying to achieve is a break-up of the business and get some recognition of a sum-of-the-parts valuation.\nIn the first instance the proposed pulp mill would become a separately defined entity that will source its own equity and debt, thus avoiding the need to gear up the head stock any further. Gunns would retain some 40 per cent of the equity.\nThe market believes Gunns will fund its portion of the pulp mill by selling 60 per cent of its $1 billion of plantation assets. It would then use the proceeds to pay down its $661 million of debt. Operationally it would also attack its cost base by culling staff.\nAnalyst reports suggest that the potential pulp mill equity partner, Swedish firm Sodra, may invest in the plantations. But again this depends on whether the proposal ever gets the go-ahead.\nVarious reports say Gunns is close to breaching its debt covenants but as long as it is keeping up with interest payments, there is probably little its lenders will do - particularly if the restructuring plan contains some debt repayment element.\nIt\u0027s not a pretty picture down south, and regardless of financing investors should be building no blue sky into their earnings on the back of this mill being built.\nBut the believers - the ones that bought into the stock in better days - are loath to sell at these prices.\nIf this company has a bank of trees with a value of $1 billion the share price does not reflect this. Even if the value of the assets are halved the stock is still trading at a discount.\nBut then the value of the trees is a factor of what they are worth once pulped and sold to the Japanese. And at this stage the answer is unknown.\nElizabeth Knight\nMore Elizabeth Knight articles\nJoin the conversation\n5 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 177 people read this\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ... 71 people read this\nCommon Business Main Index 219 people read this\nSpicy sauce to punish children 87 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 118 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nGunns mulls switch to sustainable woodchips\nPressure is growing on Gunns to rebuild its poor Japanese market with ...\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nGunns mulls switch to sustainable woodchips\nPressure is growing on Gunns to rebuild its poor Japanese market with sustainably certified woodchips, bringing closer an end to high-conflict old-growth logging in Tasmania.\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

Analysts from Goldman Sachs JBWere see Ten\u0027s EBITDA vaulting from $151 million in\n2009 to $184 million in 2010 and $273 million in 2011. The $89 million increase in earnings in 2011 is based on just $134 million in additional sales - two-thirds of increased sales drop to the EBITDA line.\nApparently the same profit growth won\u0027t be achieved at Seven, where (despite broadly comparable revenue growth) television EBITDA is expected to increase by just $3 million in 2011. According to Seven, this paltry growth in the midst of a surging advertising market is attributable to plans to invest heavily in new programming - part of efforts to ensure the network maintains its 38 per cent share of industry revenue.\nStill, a cautious approach to programming costs isn\u0027t the only area of conservatism incorporated in forecasts crafted by the Seven directors and used to brief the independent expert on the WesTrac deal.\nRemember those controversial proposed licence fee rebates announced by Senator Conroy on February 7? These are set to deliver $24 million to Seven Media Group through to June 2011, but have been \u0027\u0027excluded from the forecasts pending issue of the draft regulation and in case the regulation is disallowed\u0027\u0027. What are the chances that program investment underpinning current subdued forecasts gets revisited once the WesTrac vote\u0027s over and maximising profit re-emerges as the key priority?\nVALUE NOT ADDED\nPessimism around the outlook for Seven Media Group (the joint venture with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts that holds the Seven television, magazine and internet businesses) isn\u0027t just the domain of the Seven Network directors. The independent expert appointed to review the transaction, Deloitte, has started with the directors\u0027 forecasts and added an additional layer of gloom.\nThe expert\u0027s valuation is based on \u0027\u0027maintainable earnings\u0027\u0027 of just $300 million for the television and magazine businesses, despite these businesses being set to generate $323 million in EBITDA in the year to June - a year that got off to a poor start with advertising markets still deeply depressed through to the end of last year.\nAn approach more consistent with how market analysts currently value Ten Network would see the expert apply a reasonable multiple to SMG\u0027s 2011 forecast EBITDA. The directors forecasts put this figure at about $328 million, but a less conservative approach to program investment would add about $40 million to the figure.\nSo how much extra would a Seven Network share be worth if the expert had based the valuation of SMG on EBITDA of $368 million, rather than $300 million? That extra $68 million of earnings would translate to an additional $680 million in value, or about $1.68 per share for Seven Network shareholders.\nThe Westrac deal only just stacks up as \u0027\u0027fair and reasonable\u0027\u0027 using the independent expert\u0027s analysis. Add an extra $1.68 of value to the assessed value of Seven Network shares and that verdict would be brought into question.\nDRUG PUSHER\nSpeculation over the depth of Sigma Pharmaceuticals\u0027s financial woes started relatively quietly but has intensified over the month since the company requested its shares be put into trading halt.\nOne of the more far-fetched allegations to emerge from an industry source is a strategy that Sigma may have used in recent years to bolster its sales performance.\nApparently, in an effort to dress up end of year results, Sigma would routinely purchase large quantities of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme drugs from suppliers - such as Pfizer - shortly before year-end, only to sell the medications to other wholesalers (such as Australian Pharmaceutical Industries and Symbion) at exactly the price paid by Sigma. The sale of the drugs boosts Sigma\u0027s top-line revenue, providing at least some comfort to an investment market hungry for growth, without generating any profit.\nIn fact, window-dressing sales would actually cost Sigma money - in order to get its wholesale customers to participate in the strategy, the industry source suggests that Sigma buys the drugs on normal trading terms (requiring payment in about 30 days) while providing extended terms (possibly about four months) to the purchaser. Sigma has to wear the working capital cost of the mismatch between these terms.\nEven if true, this tactic does not lie at the core of Sigma\u0027s problems - which relate to balance sheet write-downs and consequential breaches of debt covenants - but it would ring alarm bells regarding the cultural approach underpinning the company\u0027s financial reporting.\ndsymons@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nInsider\nMore Insider articles\nJoin the conversation\n2 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 79 people read this\nCrying poor: banks generate 10%-plus ... 19 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 64 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 191 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 122 people read this\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nExecutive Style\nTravel\nMotors\nCulture\nGadgets\nManagement\nStyle\nTop 20 wine crimes\nGoon casks?

Just two months after Lihir told him to dump his pick and shovel, Hood is enjoying the riches of a \u0027\u0027termination package\u0027\u0027 totalling $5 million in cash and 1.87 million share rights.\nBut that\u0027s not all. He will also take home a further cash payment of $1.3 million in lieu of share rights he would have been entitled to if he had not been sent packing eight months short of his five-year term.\nAnd that\u0027s even before taking into account Hood\u0027s pay for the year to December, which amounted to $4.5 million (including a cash bonus of almost $632,000) - up from $3.8 million in 2008.\nHood, 56, packed his bags in January after a $450 million write-down on Lihir\u0027s failed Ballarat mine project. The company offloaded the mine for a paltry $4.5 million earlier this month.\nHe has since been replaced by the company\u0027s chief bean counter,\nPhil Baker, who will pocket a base salary of $1.9 million a year and a one-off payment of $500,000 for his endeavours.\nThe chairman of Lihir and climate-change non-sceptic, Ross Garnaut, has also taken home $322,500, up from almost $282,000 in 2008. There\u0027s obviously still gold in those hills.\nSLIPPING AWAY\nBillionaire property developer Bob Ell has always had a love of water.\nBut he\u0027s not so keen on dipping his toes into Sydney Harbour to help contractors dredge silt from in front of his four-block investment property in Cremorne.\nApart from the dredging, Ell wants to replace a slipway at the Lodge Road properties he bought two years ago for $16 million from the brothel owner Eddie Hayson.\nFacing north up Middle Harbour, his 22-metre harbour frontage has two pontoons and two boatsheds. Ell plans to redevelop what is now one of the largest waterfront properties on the north shore. the actor and Rabbitohs tragic Russell Crowe had a look over the properties before Ell snapped them up.\nEll, who was hanging out on the Gold Coast yesterday, said the planned work was merely \u0027\u0027a little bit of repairs and maintenance\u0027\u0027, but such things needed to be passed by the authorities.\nThe 65-year-old sea dog said he would be removing only about 10 buckets of silt from the harbour and replacing his existing slipway because the old railway tracks were rusted through. Despite the dredging, Ell admitted he won\u0027t be able to park his 36-metre catamaran, Leda, there because \u0027\u0027it\u0027s a little bit big\u0027\u0027. His tub, cheekily known by boaties more accustomed to smaller yachts as \u0027\u0027the floating RSL\u0027\u0027, is moored at Woolloomooloo Wharf. A decade ago it was used to cruise the Great Barrier Reef.\nThe property developer likes to keep a low profile, especially since it was revealed that the slain standover man Michael McGurk was negotiating with associates of the Kings Cross nightclub operator John Ibrahim over a joint venture with Ell to buy the Crest Hotel at Kings Cross in the weeks before he was killed. McGurk had also worked collecting debts for Ell\u0027s Leda Holdings for years.\nCRUISE CONTROL\nLike father, like son. Ell\u0027s lad, Robert , also wants to do some handiwork at the front of his waterfront digs in Mosman. And it seems he wants to go one better than his old man by increasing the size of his mooring pen so that he can fit in an 18-metre cruiser. Ell jnr paid $11 million for the five-bedroom pad on Shellbank Avenue five years ago.\nOUT OF PORTS\nThe chief bean counter at the port and rail operator Asciano, Peter McGregor, has called it quits after just two years. But don\u0027t for a minute think it has anything to do with Asciano\u0027s near-death experience last year or the swathe of strategic blunders since it was spun off from Toll Holdings in 2007.\nRather, he has hit the road so he can \u0027\u0027pursue other opportunities outside business\u0027\u0027.\nMcGregor was keeping those opportunities close to his chest yesterday.\n\u0027\u0027He is very keen to take a couple of months off but he has not indicated where he might go,\u0027\u0027 an Asciano spokeswoman said.\nBut McGregor did say in a statement that he was \u0027\u0027very proud of what has been achieved in the business in the past two years\u0027\u0027.\nWe assume he wasn\u0027t talking about the ill-fated takeover play for Brambles, in which Asciano lost more than $100 million.\nOr the capital-raising last year, which diluted shareholders four times over.\nAsciano bean counters have a history of wanting to seek other opportunities.

We had thought Clarke and Mansfield would be first on board to seek some relief after their grilling at the hands of Allco\u0027s liquidators this week.\nInstead, Investec\u0027s chief property bod, Tim Johansen, and bank chieftains Paul Siviour and Paul Hanley will be testing their sailing skills.\nThe Leighton subsidiary Thiess has taken over Bob Oatley\u0027s Wild Oats, but will be without big boss Wal King and his number cruncher, Peter Gregg - they\u0027re trotting around Asia keeping a watchful eye on Leighton Asia.\nA team from UBS will be steering Kool Cow, while it appears Royal Bank of Scotland has finally been able to find the numbers to crew Perfect Match.\nGot a tip?

This was one reason the central bank expected the Australian dollar would be  higher than the average of the past decade.\nBut he also issued the clearest warning yet against a speculative bubble in home prices, saying the recent price rises risked turning into a  speculative bubble that would be \"unhelpful\".\nThe property bubble: it\u0027s here already\nRising home prices have been one reason the central bank has hiked interest  rates four times since October, a far more aggressive unwinding of stimulus than  any other country.\nThe Australian dollar duly rallied after his hawkish speech while bill futures slid as investors revised up the chance of a rise in the 4.0 per cent cash rate as early as next month.\nHis confidence helped the Australian dollar pare early losses and rise a quarter of a US cent to $US0.9110. It had slipped overnight when a Fitch downgrade of Portugal stirred fesh worries of debt contagion in the euro zone.\n\"The RBA remains very upbeat and that means a rate hike in April is more likely than not,\" said Rory Robertson, interest rates strategist at Macquarie.\nThe central bank has already lifted rates by a full percentage point in six months and the market was now implying a 57 per cent probability of a move to 4.25 percent at the next policy meeting on April 6, up from below 50 per cent before the speech.\nThat was a marked swing from a 25 percent probability early this month and came despite escalating concerns about sovereign debt in the euro zone which had tempered the global appetite for risk.\nSome analysts had thought the angst over debt abroad might deter the RBA from moving at home, but Mr Lowe seemed to think otherwise.\n\"The alternative of waiting to see how the myriad of risks evolves before adjusting policy runs the significant downside of moving too late, particularly given that the economy is starting this upswing with less spare capacity than in previous upswings,\" Mr Lowe said.\nHe alsso pointed to a number of challenges globally, including  the need for some indebted countries to tighten their belts, the need for Asian  countries to promote domestic demand and the likelihood that higher interest  rates in Asia would suck in capital putting upward pressure on asset prices and  currencies.\nAll these posed risks to the RBA\u0027s positive outlook for Australia but that  had not stopped it lifting rates.\n\"The alternative of waiting to see how the myriad of risks evolves before  adjusting policy runs the significant downside of moving too late, particularly  given that the economy is starting this upswing with less spare capacity than in  previous upswings,\" Mr Lowe said in a speech to an industry conference.\nMr Lowe noted recent domestic data had been firm, with employment growth robust,  business and consumer confidence above average, the housing market strong and  signs that businesses were borrowing again.\n\"Collectively, these outcomes provide us with some confidence that the  economy is now in a reasonably solid upswing,\" he said.\nSharp increase in prices for coal and iron ore, Australia\u0027s two biggest  export earners, would deliver a significant rise in the country\u0027s terms of  trade.\nThis was a boon to business investment, the government\u0027s budget position,  asset values, overall confidence in the economy and the growth of domestic  incomes.\nMr Lowe noted the housing market had been very buoyant with auction clearance  rates high and measures of home prices rising by around 1 per cent a month. There  were a few signs the market might be cooling, and a pick-up in home construction  would help somewhat. Banks were also tending to tighten lending standards rather  than loosen them.\n\"This is good news, as it would obviously be unhelpful if a speculative cycle  were to emerge on the back of the recent strength in housing prices,\" Mr Lowe  cautioned. \"This is an area that lenders and current and prospective home owners  will need to watch carefully over the months ahead.\"\nMr Lowe said underlying inflation still looked like slowing to around 2.5  per cent this year, from 3.2 per cent last quarter.\n\"In addition, the Reserve Bank\u0027s liaison with retailers suggests that there  has been significant discounting recently, and business surveys point to below  average price increases.\"\nExpanding the supply side of the economy and easing bottlenecks would help  keep inflation anchored, he added.\n\"In addition, as the Bank has noted a number of times, with the economy  having relatively limited spare capacity, it is likely that interest rates will  need to continue their gradual move towards more normal levels,\" said Mr Lowe.\nReuters\nComments\n92 comments\nGlad I fixed the lions share of my mortgage at 6% for 5 years.

It is needed to keep the economy stable. Of course, I hate having to pay extra on my mortgage every month, but I also realise that economic stability is essential, otherwise I may well be out of a job.\nHaving said that, I hope rates don\u0027t rise for the next few months, at least. ;)\nDeeK - March 25, 2010, 11:33AM\nUntil central banks in general, and the RBA in particular, come to understand that they must regulate not only the cost of credit (interest rates) but also the SUPPLY of credit (in terms of enforced standards on leverage and lending quality), we will continue to witness these arms-race induced asset bubbles.\nUnder Greenspan, the US Fed believed they were unable to even know what an asset bubble looked like! Of course it seemingly didn\u0027t occur to them to simply look at capital appreciation rates versus long run historical averages, or to consider simple metrics like median property prices to median incomes. Unbelievable.\nDave | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 11:36AM\nHouse prices rise mainly due to the availability of credit and the propensity of people to pay the asking prices. The raising of interest rates would not only stop home prices rising dead in their tracks but also the impact the economic recovery.\nPerhaps the government could look at raising the capital requirements of the Australian banks to restrict the supply of credit available to the market while still allowing the RBA flexibility to tackle inflationary pressures?\nAny thoughts out there on this?\nBedroom Economist - March 25, 2010, 11:36AM\nGrammar 101, that was actually quoted from Lowe.\nThank you, that is all.\nReading 101 | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 11:39AM\nShow more comments\nComments are now closed\nJoin the conversation\n10 people are reading this now.\n92 comments .\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 129 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 218 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 214 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 203 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 121 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nApril rate rise no certainty: economists\n11:31am\nThe Reserve Bank will gradually increase interest rates, but an April ...\nHigher rates dampening housing finance: RBA\n11:48am\nThe household and business sectors have benefited from improved economic ...\nAustralia\u0027s property bubble: it\u0027s here\nThere is no indication that investor appetite for property will slow ...\nFitch cuts Portugal\u0027s credit rating as debt crisis heightens\n25 Mar\nPortugal\u0027s credit grade was cut by Fitch Ratings for the first time, ...\nMortgage rates still below average: RBA\n12:13pm\nInterest rates for mortgage holders are about 50 basis points below the ...\nTop Business articles\nBubble risk: Rates set to rise, RBA says\nPoms go home, lured by cheap pound\nShares close marginally lower\nWoodside quashes Santos takeover talk\nThe rate is on: cash-hungry banks out to woo depositors\nMore Business articles\nBusiness Topics\nCompaniesExpand (7753)\nAll Companies (7753)\nAMP (1399)\nWestpac (899)\nANZ (870)\nCommonwealth Bank (819)\nRio Tinto (729)\nBHP Billiton (716)\nNAB (531)\nTelstra (516)\nSeek (500)\nWoolworths (404)\nQantas (376)\nWesfarmers (288)\nAXA (256)\nSantos (229)\nDavid Jones (226)\nWoodside Petroleum (222)\nFortescue Metals (184)\nING (181)\nFairfax Media (166)\nSeven Network (155)\nOil Search (153)\nCrown (152)\nVirgin Blue (152)\nLeighton (145)\nOrigin Energy (145)\nAWB (138)\nERA (137)\nLend Lease (136)\nWestfield (115)\nHarvey Norman (113)\nLihir Gold (112)\nCSR (110)\nCentro (109)\nMacquarie Airports (107)\nOZ Minerals (105)\nPerpetual (105)\nFoster\u0027s (102)\nBank of Queensland (100)\nMacquarie Bank (99)\nAsciano (93)\nTransurban (91)\nAGL (87)\nTabcorp (85)\nNewcrest Mining (81)\nBunnings (81)\nArrow Energy (81)\nABC Learning (80)\nGreat Southern (80)\nBankWest (78)\nJB Hi-Fi (76)\nMirvac (74)\nSuncorp-Metway (74)\nConsolidated Media Holdings (74)\nJames Hardie (73)\nGunns (71)\nGPT (69)\nAmcor (67)\nStockland (67)\nGoodman (64)\nTimbercorp (63)\nToll Holdings (63)\nBrambles (63)\nNufarm (61)\nMacarthur Coal (60)\nLion Nathan (57)\nTatts (56)\nElders (56)\nTen Network (54)\nMore Companies\nPeopleExpand (4263)\nAll People (4263)\nJames Packer (156)\nRupert Murdoch (144)\nKerry Stokes (133)\nRalph Norris (113)\nCameron Clyne (98)\nMike Smith (95)\nGail Kelly (90)\nMarius Kloppers (88)\nDavid Thodey (88)\nAlan Joyce (72)\nAndrew Forrest (72)\nSol Trujillo (66)\nCraig Dunn (64)\nTom Albanese (60)\nClive Palmer (57)\nMore People\nTopicsExpand (2981)\nAll Topics (2981)\nInterest Rates (1370)\nGlobal Financial Crisis (1216)\nSuperannuation (365)\nPension (239)\nStimulus Package (180)\nBudget Deficit (124)\nMore Topics\nOrganisationsExpand (2649)\nAll Organisations (2649)\nReserve Bank (1393)\nASX (619)\nASIC (417)\nACCC (194)\nAPRA (78)\nLatest Comment\nAgree with Phil H - good summary and with Williarrmo re the doom-mongers these blogs seem ...

One premiership cup, another near miss and a regular table at the big finals dance would more than justify the fact a long list of retiring champions, and the club\u0027s limited access to early draft picks, would leave it threadbare. That is how the AFL draft/salary cap system is supposed to work.\nNow? If you had not been impressed by a team containing a strong blend of young and experienced recruits during a successful pre-season, then the buoyant atmosphere the revitalised Swans brought to their guernsey presentation last week created the feeling that conventional wisdom could be defied.\nNot only does it seem Roos will leave a robust list for new coach John Longmire, but he might yet give himself a September farewell with those of us who had pencilled the Swans into a respectable 10th or 11th now trying to find room for them in the eight.\nWhether Sydney can meet these expectations will depend on the performance of a few seasoned recruits - particularly veteran forward Daniel Bradshaw. You might add virtual recruit Tadhg Kennelly, who gives the Swans, with Rhys Shaw, Martin Mattner and the reborn Nick Malceski, a superb battalion of rebounding defenders.\nUnusually, the contributions of some exciting rookies such as Lewis Jetta and Gary Rohan will also have an immediate impact, underlining a change at a club that has usually allowed youngsters to ripen slowly in the reserves. As much as Roos swears by the fundamentals of his coaching, the selection of these youngsters is a change in philosophy.\nThe most significant remark Roos made during the pre-season was an admission that he persisted with the recruitment of tough, hard-bodied but not particularly pacy midfielders for a season too long. Largely this was because this prototype had served him well. But, partly, it might also have been because he bravely spoke out against the rule changes that have taken the game to warp speed.\nThe drafting and immediate selection of Jetta is symbolic.\nWhen the Herald reported last year that the Swans had not recruited an Aboriginal player since 1998 - an unusually long time for a team that had benefited so heavily from the contributions of champions Adam Goodes and Michael O\u0027Loughlin - the topic was sensitive. The Swans had, recruiters pointed out, intended to draft several Aborigines but had simply been trumped.\nHowever, instantly, Jetta\u0027s lightning outside pace has given the Swans some idea of what they might have been missing.\nYet the fundamentals remain. Speaking as only he can, in the tongues of both Vince Lombardi and the Dalai Lama, co-captain Brett Kirk told the new Swans what was expected at the guernsey presentation.\n\u0027\u0027We will always look in the mirror and not outside the window,\u0027\u0027 he said. \u0027\u0027We will continue to take responsibility for where we are at and this, I can guarantee you - we will never lay blame on others, use bad luck or factors outside our walls as an excuse.\n\u0027\u0027You open yourself up to be challenged, to become a better footballer and a greater person. This jumper not only stands for a strong body but an equally strong mind and you give back. You take time to give back to yourself, to your teammates, the supporters and your community.\u0027\u0027\nMaybe, these revitalised Swans can again give the gift of finals football.\nJoin the conversation\nYou\u0027re the only person reading this now.

Photo: Steve Christo\nSydney recruit Lewis Jetta hasn\u0027t had to wait long for his crack at the AFL, writes  Michael Cowley.\nIt took Swan Districts coach Brian Dawson just one pre-season game last year to realise it was extremely unlikely Lewis Jetta would have a lengthy career at his club. It wasn\u0027t as though the kid was no good, Dawson knew exactly how good he was. But now it was out there for the entire football world to see.\n\u0027\u0027He played some colts games for the club the year before but didn\u0027t finish the season, deciding to head home to Bunbury,\u0027\u0027 Dawson said. \u0027\u0027We knew he had talent and we were keen to get him back up [to Perth] again. And we did. He came up for pre-season, leading into 2009 and he certainly showed his wares.\n\u0027\u0027Almost from day one, we were pretty certain he would be a good player for us, and the AFL wasn\u0027t beyond him.\u0027\u0027\nThe AFL was just 13 months away. Tomorrow night the 20-year-old will make his debut for Sydney in the club\u0027s season opener against St Kilda.\n\u0027\u0027It was February last year when the [West Coast] Eagles had an intra-club game, and they generally ask for some WAFL players to help make up the numbers,\u0027\u0027 Dawson explained. \u0027\u0027He played in one of those, and he kicked a couple of long goals on the run, made some great runs from halfback, and everyone sat up and took notice from that, and they continued to take notice all season.\n\u0027\u0027His asset that captures everyone\u0027s attention is his lightning speed. He\u0027s one of the fastest players I\u0027ve ever seen, and he really came of age last year. He\u0027s a kid who enjoys playing the game, you can see that in the way he approaches the game, and also he came out of his shell last season, which was really pleasing to see.\n\u0027\u0027But we all expected he was going to go somewhere. Our only hope was he might have been drafted to West Coast or Fremantle [meaning he could play with Swan Districts when not in the senior team], but that\u0027s luck of the draw. Sydney are a great club and they are a good fit for Lewis.\u0027\u0027\nAs Jetta walked onto ANZ Stadium yesterday for the team\u0027s final training session before the premiership begins, you could see the kid from Bunbury. He glanced up at the towering stands, and tried to take in the vastness of the venue, the place he had seen on TV a decade ago when it hosted the Olympics.\n\u0027\u0027It\u0027s huge,\u0027\u0027 he said. \u0027\u0027I don\u0027t think it will be daunting having a big crowd. I love big crowds, but I think the biggest crowd last year was 5000 and to me that was a lot.\n\u0027\u0027I think with 30 or 40,000, I might be a little bit scared. But as soon as I got drafted I said I wanted to play round one and I worked hard at training and it\u0027s paid off.\u0027\u0027\nJetta says he tried to play it cool when coach Paul Roos told him he was playing against the Saints. He said he \u0027\u0027tried not to smile, but I was excited and pretty happy\u0027\u0027.\nHis parents, one of his brothers, and \u0027\u0027a couple of aunties and uncles\u0027\u0027 are on their way from Western Australia. \u0027\u0027I think they have booked out a plane full of Jettas,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nPerhaps they should be flying Jetstar. Jetta produced a dazzling display when he debuted in the NAB Cup against Carlton at Blacktown last month, and during the game, when he came from the field for a break, a pocket of the crowd began chanting: \u0027\u0027Jetstar!\u0027\u0027\n\u0027\u0027I could hear this \u0027Jetstar\u0027, I loved it,\u0027\u0027 Jetta recalled.\n\u0027\u0027That\u0027s what I wanted to do, I wanted to get recognised so people know who I am.\n\u0027\u0027When I first heard it, I was a bit shocked, but got pretty pumped up afterwards.\u0027\u0027\nJetta is unsure whether he will wear the bright green boots he has worn during the pre-season or will revert to basic black for the momentous occasion. But what won\u0027t change is the electric way he plays.\n\u0027\u0027The coaches have basically said they want me to run with the ball, but I\u0027m such a team player normally,\u0027\u0027 he said. \u0027\u0027I think I need to be selfish a bit more.\u0027\u0027\nWhile Jetta made the cut, Sydney\u0027s other first-round draft pick, Gary Rohan, missed out, as did Paul Bevan and Nick Smith from the 24 the Swans took to Narrandera for their final practice match.\n\u0027\u0027We had a lot of discussion. Nick Smith was really close, Gary Rohan and Paul Bevan, they\u0027re guys we would have been happy with in the side,\u0027\u0027 said Roos, who expects former Lion Daniel Bradshaw to play about 80 minutes tomorrow.\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 107 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 244 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 174 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 111 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 203 people read this\nTop Real Footy articles\nPreview: Richmond v Carlton\nAFL uses AusAid in Africa\nAFL round one teams\nYoung, keen and quick: Jetstar is ready for take-off in Swans colours\nGay AFL players safe with me: McGuire\nMore Real Footy articles\nAFL Topics\nPeopleExpand (5424)\nAll People (5424)\nPaul Roos (506)\nBen Cousins (505)\nBarry Hall (458)\nBrendan Fevola (432)\nGary Ablett (414)\nChris Judd (400)\nNick Riewoldt (382)\nRoss Lyon (303)\nRodney Eade (290)\nLance Franklin (289)\nMatthew Lloyd (278)\nMichael Voss (274)\nJonathan Brown (271)\nMick Malthouse (267)\nMark Williams (249)\nAndrew Demetriou (248)\nMark Thompson (242)\nLuke Ball (229)\nAdam Goodes (228)\nDaniel Bradshaw (226)\nMatthew Knights (225)\nSteve Johnson (221)\nLuke Hodge (202)\nNick Maxwell (202)\nBrett Kirk (201)\nLenny Hayes (201)\nAndrew Lovett (198)\nJustin Koschitzke (195)\nJoel Selwood (194)\nNathan Brown (192)\nAlastair Clarkson (189)\nJason Akermanis (188)\nBrad Johnson (188)\nJimmy Bartel (187)\nJarryd Roughead (186)\nMatthew Richardson (185)\nPaul Chapman (184)\nBrett Ratten (184)\nSam Mitchell (182)\nKevin Sheedy (180)\nAlan Didak (177)\nMatthew Scarlett (177)\nDarren Jolly (176)\nCameron Ling (172)\nTom Harley (172)\nMarc Murphy (169)\nAdam Cooney (168)\nAnthony Rocca (167)\nJosh Fraser (167)\nNick Dal Santo (164)\nDean Bailey (160)\nTravis Cloke (160)\nMatthew Pavlich (157)\nScott Pendlebury (156)\nHeath Shaw (155)\nBrian Lake (155)\nDane Swan (154)\nBrendon Goddard (154)\nPaul Medhurst (154)\nSimon Black (153)\nLeon Davis (152)\nJobe Watson (152)\nScott Lucas (149)\nTom Hawkins (147)\nZac Dawson (147)\nBrad Sewell (146)\nStephen Milne (145)\nMore People\nTeamsExpand (5367)\nAll Teams (5367)\nSt Kilda (1710)\nBulldogs (1358)\nSwans (1098)\nLions (998)\nPort Adelaide (935)\nCats (824)\nTigers (703)\nHawks (671)\nMagpies (669)\nBombers (622)\nBlues (621)\nDemons (493)\nEagles (484)\nCrows (437)\nKangaroos (416)\nDockers (312)\nMore Teams\nIssuesExpand (3916)\nAll Issues (3916)\nFinals (1361)\nDraft (1176)\nGrand final (888)\nInjuries (828)\nUmpires (667)\nBetting (230)\nBrownlow Medal (207)\nBump (168)\nOff-season (159)\nMore Issues\nCompetitionsExpand (3625)\nAll Competitions (3625)\nAFL (3351)\nVFL (647)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nEditor\u0027s Picks\nPre-season: where is your club at?\nA club by club guide to who was firing and who is floundering during pre-season practice matches.\nSlideshow\nDogs end trophy drought\nSlideshow The Western Bulldogs claim their first AFL trophy in 40 years, with a seven-goal haul from Barry Hall spearheading a 40-point NAB Cup grand final win.\nKarl Quinn\nTV\u0027s footy flood\nAs more new players enter TV\u0027s football ratings game, no one can afford to drop the ball.\nBest tips can be found in the past\nFooty scribe Michael Gleeson is well aware of how teams can have a sometimes perplexing head-to-head record.\nPhotos\nSaints hold off Swans in NAB Cup thriller\nSt Kilda wins another match by one point to progress to the semi-finals of the NAB Cup.\nJake Niall\u0027s tipping secrets\nWhat principles is Age footy expert Jake Niall guided by when making his weekly AFL tips?\nRoos get new premises\nNorth Melbourne opens new $15 million training and administrative centre.\nAFL draft top ten\nThe players the AFL clubs wanted first at the 2009 national draft.\nPrev\nNext\nReal Footy Photos\nNew year, same tune\nCrows pip Blues at Visy Park\nEagles and Demons battle at Casey Fields\nYour club\u0027s X-Factor\nNAB Cup grand final\nSaints crush Dockers\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

Here\u0027s some opinions to chew on as you contemplate your fateful choices for the first time this season.\nRichmond v Carlton\nThursday March 25 MCG\nWhy the Tigers will win:\nGulp. Wellâ€¦ Richmondâ€™s potentially potent midfield, with the likes of Deledio, Tambling, Cotchin, Cousins, Jackson and Martin will match the Judd-less Blues on-ballers. Up forward, Jack Riewoldt, Mitch Morton and Robin Nahas are young, lively, skilled up-and-comers who will share the load and outscore their unsettled Blues counterparts. With Carlton trying to bed down a new, slower moving gameplan, a new forward line and missing the brilliance and leadership of captain Chris Judd, the Tigers, playing with no expectations, and welcoming exciting newcomers Martin and Roberts, will play with freedom and score more easily than their fancied opponents.\nit\u0027s back: Carlton and Richmond kick off the season again. Photo: Paul Rovere\nWhy the Blues will win:\nCarlton is simply a better team than Richmond - more skilled and possessing the greater depth of talent. The midfield, even without Judd, oozes class, led by Murphy, Gibbs, Simpson, McLean, Carazzo, Joseph, Scotland and Walker, and their underrated defence will not be worried by their small Richmond opponents. If this game is tight, Carltonâ€™s defensive pressure will force repeated mistakes from the inexperienced and erratic Tigers, and the turnovers will produce goals. The media is overstating the hole that Fevola will leave, and Richmond will struggle to cover the new-look, multi-pronged forward line. The white-hot Betts, the elusive Yarran, livewire Robinson, and promising tall Henderson will get enough opportunities to combine for a winning score.\nWhat we really think: Carlton by 15 points.\nDonâ€™t be tempted by the Tiges! Neither of these teams impressed in pre-season, but the last real game the Blues played was a final, and Richmond is years away from playing one of those â€“ let that be a sobering reminder of the relative class of these two outfits. Richmond are more likely to provide upsets a few weeks down the track, when they have begun to implement new coach Damien Hardwickâ€™s gameplan.\nGeelong v Essendon\nFriday March 26 MCG\nWhy Geelong will win:\n3AW pundit Brian Taylor is the man to listen to on this one: do the midfield match-ups and see which team is going to get hold of the ball. That pits Ablett, Bartel, Corey, Enright, Selwood, Ling, Kelly and Chapman against Watson, McVeigh, Prismall, Welsh, Stanton,Winderlich, Dyson and Hocking. The Cats have won their last four against the Dons because of this midfield dominance â€“ the closest margin in those games being 42 points. And since these teams last met, the Bombers have lost pacy onballer Andrew Lovett. The Essendon forward line may be new and exciting, but it could get cold during this game waiting for opportunities from further up the field.\nWhy Essendon will win:\nThe Bombers are fit and firing, with a full complement of big men for the first time in recent years. They catch a Geelong which by its own admission will not be fully wound up until round three. The Cats also lost Harley from their grand final team, and are missing Varcoe, Stokes and Hogan from their best line-up. Furthermore, some of their old-timers were rested from training during pre-season, Corey missed most of pre-season, Josh Hunt is returning after a serious knee injury and a handful of newbies will fill out their bench. Geelong will depend on one withering burst to establish a winning lead. If the fitter Bombers restrict the damage during this inevitable event, their hard work over the course of the match could deliver a big upset. Then there\u0027s the distraction of the endless discussion about Gary Ablett\u0027s future, a \u0027one-percenter\u0027 that may have unsettled some Cats.\nWhat we really think: Geelong by 27 points.\nGeelong has the wood on Essendon, and it is just too good for middle of the road teams, even if it is a little underdone.\nMelbourne v Hawthorn\nSaturday March 27 MCG\nWhy Melbourne will win:\nSure, there are some big names missing from the Demons line-up, but it will be underestimated backmen who will win this one for the Dees â€“ it will be the unheralded likes of Bennell, Garland, Frawley, Rivers, Warnock and MacDonald restricting the depleted Hawk forward line (Franklin suspended, Rioli hurt, Williams gone, others underdone). The Demons defenders have been the heroes of Melbourneâ€™s recent Dark Age, and their dour efforts will give the newly invigorated midfield the chances to create a winning score. The Demons that run out will be as fit as can be; Hawthorn may have to play several underdone stars after suffering an injury curse during pre-season. The desperate Dees can win ugly if they hold sole forward threat Roughead, and break even with midfield stars Mitchell and Hodge.\nWhy Hawthorn will win:\nSure, the Hawks have been hit hard by injury, but the Dees are still taking an age to get the ball forward, and then often miss their targets. And once they get forward of centre, they will be kicking to a low-scoring journeyman (Brad Miller, 19 goals last year), a promising but slightly build flanker (Ricky Petterd 29 games, 25 goals), and maybe a raw athlete needed in the ruck (Stefan Martin, 27 games, 6 goals). That line-up will be handled without too much fuss by the Hawk backline, which has been bolstered by the inclusion of Josh Gibson and the return of Gilham and Ladson. And in the midfield, Mitchell, Hodge, Lewis, Ellis and Bateman will educate Melbourne\u0027s high draft picks Scully and Trengove with bruises.\nWhat we really think: Hawthorn by 35 points.\nThis game should offer a good opportunity to pick an upset, but Melbourne has been as ravaged by injury as Hawthorn, and the Hawks start from a much higher base. The Dees need to turn around some diabolical pre-season form. Wait until they show some coherence before tipping them at all.\nSydney v St Kilda\nSaturday March 27 ANZ Stadium\nWhy Sydney will win:\nThe Swans are in fine form, and have transformed their team from the dour outfit that finished out of the eight last season. They have added the pace of Kennelly, Jetta, Rohan and McGlynn, and revitalised former backline creator Nick Malceski to create a backlog for midfield and half-back options. Those players, and the likes of Shaw and Oâ€™Keefe, will compete well with a Saints midfield lacking its heartbeat Lenny Hayes. With Goodes, White and Bradshaw up forward to trouble a St Kilda defence missing its general Sam Fisher, there is no reason the Swans cannot continue its recent good record against St Kilda.\nWhy St Kilda will win:\nSt Kildaâ€™s only recent losses have been in grand finals, to the best teams in the business. They will miss Hayes and Fisher, but their ascendancy is based on supreme teamwork, and they won convincingly the last time they were missing big names (round 19, 2009 v Hawthorn in Tasmania). Though they have had several close tussles with the Swans in recent years, they have usually prevailed, including a one-point win during pre-season, when the Swans were flying, and the Saints were far from their best form. Montagna, Goddard and dal Santo will not be subdued all night, and Riewoldt and Koschitzke donâ€™t need many opportunities to do damage.\nWhat we really think: Sydney by 11 points.\nIf you are looking for an upset, this looks like the logical choice. Sydney was within 15 points in their two clashes last season, and looks a lot stronger now. The Saints looked a little flat by the end of pre-season and are lacking their most important midfielder and defender.\nBrisbane v West Coast\nSaturday March 27 Gabba\nWhy Brisbane will win:\nThe Lions have a pretty impressive line-up at the moment, as much by virtue of the players who might miss out on a game, as much as the newcomers within it. The well-performed Polkinghorne is struggling to get a game, and Sheldon, Stiller, Proud, Collier and Charman are likely to be in the stands watching. This is genuine depth, unlike the competition for places at West Coast, where a raft of young players are being selected more on potential than performance in AFL games. Brisbane should do better than break even in the midfield, thanks to the ongoing brilliance of Black and the quality of Power, Rich and Rischitelli. This should provide their forward line talls Fevola, Brown and Staker with enough chances to put together a winning score.\nWhy West Coast will win:\nA new Eagles juggernaut is landing, and this first win will confirm that the young West Coast players are taking their team back to the top. Masten, Shuey, Swift, Scott Selwood, Josh Kennedy, Eric McKenzie, Brad Ebert and Mark le Cras are combining to enliven a dour midfield. The on-ball options will swamp the Lions midfield, which still relies too heavily on too few, and the spread of goalkicking options, with Lynch permanently settled in the forward line, will get plenty of chances. Brisbaneâ€™s recruits apart from Fevola are not stars, and it remains to be seen if this Lions outfit is significantly stronger than last yearâ€™s model. All this before we mention the Eagle X-factor Nic Naitanui, who is shaping as a gamebreaker on the ball and moving forward.\nWhat we really think: Brisbane by 40 points\nBrisbane is always hard to beat at home, and with few serious injuries, hits this game full of confidence. Its elite players Brown, Black, Fevola are fit â€“ Eagle lynchpins Cox, Priddis and Kerr are underdone. The Eagles forward line still does not reek of goalkicking power, apart from le Cras. And the vaunted youngsters have it all to do against the fierce pressure that the hardened Lions will provide.\nPort Adelaide v North Melbourne\nSunday March 28 AAMI Stadium\nWhy Port Adelaide will win:\nPort has momentum after an energising pre-season, with a new-found toughness and hunger, brought on by the injection of rookies and second-chance journeymen playing for their football lives. They are at home, in form, and are more seasoned than the baby Kangaroos, who face a bright future, but some tough games in the meantime. The refinement of their defensive game in the midfield will stymie the North Melbourne kids, who have verve, but not experience and hard bodies. And the North Melbourne forward line will struggle to put together a winning score with their best tall forward Drew Petrie sidelined by a foot injury.\nWhy North Melbourne will win:\nThe Kangaroos had a productive pre-season, where they unveiled an aggressive, hard-running possession game and a new, forward-looking attitude. Arden Street is buoyant, and keen for challenges, no longer embracing the dubious benefits of being an underdog. North has a tradition of victory against Port, and beat them at AAMI Stadium in their most recent premiership match (round 22, 2009). The youthful run of Ziebell, Wright and Swallow is buttressed by veterans Harding and Harvey, the defence is young but tough and mean, headed by Scott Thompson and Nathan Grima, and their ruck division is imposing, with McIntosh helped by Goldstein and Hale. Portâ€™s team is a melange of cast-offs, kids and former stars, and it is yet to prove it has jelled into a potent force.\nWhat we really think: Port Power by 1 point\nA toss of the coin job, this one. We liked North Melbourne until news of the Petrie injury came though. The forward line now looks entirely unconvincing, with only the ruck convert Hale as a first choice tall. It should still be a tight contest, but Port Adelaide have Tredrea and possibly Motlop up forward, so should find goals easier to conjure.\nWestern Bulldogs v Collingwood\nSunday March 28 Etihad Stadium\nWhy the Bulldogs will win:\nAfter losing to the Pies last season by a point in round 15, the Bulldogs went to school on Collingwood, and reversed the outcome with a policy of â€˜keepings-offâ€™ in round 22. Though Collingwood has improved its potential for ball-winning with the procurement of on-baller Luke Ball and ruckman Darren Jolly, the man-on-man match-ups in the midfield still favour the Bulldogs. And there are fewer Bulldogs players with question marks over their output. Magpie Reid, Sidebottom, Beams and Anthony lack experience; teammates Cloke, Thomas, Didak and Davis have something to prove under finals-like pressure. And that is what the Bulldogs will provide. As significant as the recruitment of Barry Hall could prove, the big improvement with the Western Bulldogs is in their hard-bitten pressure on the ball-carrier. Their tackle counts in pre-season show that the Dogs are doing all the hard things which will make them a little better than fellow contenders like Collingwood.\nWhy Collingwood will win:\nHaving strengthened their line-up, and the bodies of some young stars, with an almost perfect pre-season, the Pies enter round one as an undeserved underdog. The addition of Ball and Jolly will improve their ball-winning power, and reduce their reliance on rebounding from defence for scoring opportunities. The Dogs cannot help but have a let-down after such a euphoric pre-season grand final win, and could be ripe for a shock loss, having been hyped as this yearâ€™s premiers by so many pundits. It should not be forgotten that these two teams were separated by four goals over the entirety of 2009. It could be argued that the Pies have improved their team as much, if not more than the Dogs since then.\nWhat we really think: Western Bulldogs by 13 points.\nExpect a classic, and a close one. The Dogs backmen have the wood on their direct Magpie opponents, and that could be enough to sway this game their way. The Bulldogs also look to have an extra touch of class that could prove crucial in the clinches.\nFremantle v Adelaide\nSunday March 28 Subiaco\nWhy Fremantle will win:\nAdelaide may name a strong looking team, but it will be an illusion. Up to nine of its elite stars have been hampered by injury in pre-season, and if they play will lack both conditioning and match practice. Freoâ€™s spirited kids and rookies could run them off their legs on the big Subiaco ground, especially with Sandilands likely to dominate the ruck stoppages. The new-look Docker forward line should be more capable of capitalising on its opportunities, with Mayne fit, Pavlich in place and the nimble Michael Johnson added.\nWhy Adelaide will win:\nThe Crows are simply too good a team to let a game like this slip. They have stars on every line, and are eyeing the top four, not trying to avoid the bottom four. The Freo rookies who shone in pre-season will find opponents breathing down their necks all game now that the real thing is underway, and Tippett, Porplyzia, Hentschel and co will get a feast of goalscoring opportunities from their midfield guns Vince, Goodwin, McLeod, Thompson and Mackay. The last time these two teams played, Adelaide won 130-13.\nWhat we really think: Adelaide by 37 points\nThe Dockers are too shambolic when in possession of the ball, and will be eaten alive by the professionalism and swarming running pressure of the Crows, even if a few senior Crows don\u0027t make the trip.Â \nSource: theage.com.au\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this

The 1946 canvas sold to an  undisclosed telephone bidder for $4.5 million before the buyer\u0027s premium was  added, drawing a round of applause. The canvas is thought to be the only one in  Nolan\u0027s celebrated first series of 27 Kelly paintings not in the National  Gallery of Australia in Canberra. It was sold by the Vizard Foundation, overseen  by the businessman Steve Vizard, who bought it for a reported $400,000 in 1992.  It has mainly been on show at the National Gallery of Victoria since then.\nThe sale of about 215 works, coming as the fine-art auction year gathers  steam, was seen as the first barometer of art-market conditions after last  year\u0027s downturn.\nArt-market analyst Michael Reid said the result was a \u0027\u0027wonderful  money-vitamin shot in the arm to the industry that has been anaemic for the last  12 months\u0027\u0027.\n\u0027\u0027Sidney Nolan is one of Australia\u0027s most important 20th-century artists and  the Kelly series is his most significant contribution to Australian art history  and theory,\u0027\u0027 he said. \u0027\u0027The Kelly myth is so central to the way we see  ourselves.\u0027\u0027\nThe previous auction record for Australian art was $3.48 million, reached in  2007 - the market\u0027s last bumper year - for Brett Whiteley\u0027s sexualised landscape The Olgas for Ernest Giles.\nMenzies Art Brands\u0027 chairman, Rod Menzies, said he was thrilled with the  price. \"The sale demonstrates a growing confidence in the Australian art  market.\"\nIt was not all upbeat. A range of paintings failed to meet their price  estimates. The next down from the Nolan, Whiteley\u0027s View from the Sitting  Room Window, Lavender Bay, went for $1.2 million under the hammer, the low  end of its estimate.\nThe Vizard Foundation said it would use the proceeds for charitable  projects.\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 181 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 140 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 148 people read this\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ... 124 people read this\nKeneally\u0027s challenge: turning vibes into ... 16 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nMissing Nolan heralds more buoyant market\nA rare Sidney Nolan painting that will have its first Sydney viewing ...\nTop Entertainment articles\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas\nActor Robert Culp collapses and dies\nLady Gaga cracks 1 billion views\nKevin Smith vows: \u0027I\u0027ll make critics pay\u0027\nThe Last Song\nMore Entertainment articles\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nMissing Nolan heralds more buoyant market\nA rare Sidney Nolan painting that will have its first Sydney viewing today is tipped to break Australian art\u0027s record auction price.

Its total national audience was 647,000.\nIts Victorian counterpart, an AFL-themed program, The Bounce, hosted by Peter Helliar, aired on Wednesday in the \"AFL\" states Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. From next week the two shows will air on the same night in the same timeslot.\nComments\nBe the first to comment.\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

Lady Gaga.\nShe pushes boundaries with her film clips, her fashion and even her sexuality but now Lady Gaga is pushing a boundary of a different kind - online views.\nHer music videos have proved so popular in cyberspace that she is the first person to crack 1 billion views.\nOnline analytics company Visible Measures reports this week that according to its True Reach methodology Lady Gaga has surpassed its so-called 100 Million Views Club to be the sole member of the billion views club.\nIt was no single clip that pushed her over the line, rather a combination of her top three: Poker Face (374,606,128 views), Bad Romance (360,020,327) and Just Dance (272,941,674).\nThese three videos combined take her to 1,007,568,129 views, and that isn\u0027t taking into account the views from her other hit songs, such as LoveGame, Paparazzi and the recent release Telephone, featuring Beyonce (who is also an online sensation).\nThis is no small achievement considering Lady Gaga has only been on the scene for two years. Her first single, Just Dance, was released in the US in April 2008.\nSince then she has taken the world by storm with her blend of trashy europop, racy lyrics and even racier outfits. She most recently has been entertaining Australian audiences with her live show The Monster Ball .\nThis latest accolade is just one of a long list which includes 9 Billboard Music Awards, 2 Grammy Awards and countless other music industry awards.\nThe pop star is also no stranger to online love, being one of the most popular users on Twitter with more than 3 million followers.\nAlthough she might not want to get too comfortable being the most-viewed artist online because she faces strong competition from the Twilight series.\nThe trailers for the first two vampire teen romances both make Visible Measures\u0027 top 10, so far attracting 983,936,059 views.Â \nWith the release of the third film Eclipse just around the corner, Lady Gaga could very well soon be eclipsed herself.\nTop 10 online videos (as at 23 March 2010)\n1 Soulja Boy: Crank Dat - 722,438,268\n2 Twilight Saga: New Moon - 639,966,996\n3 Beyonce: Single Ladies - 522,039,429\n4 Michael Jackson: Thriller - 443,535,722\n5 The Gummy Bear Song - 394,327,606\n6 Lady Gaga: Poker Face - 374,606,128\n7 Lady Gaga: Bad Romance - 360,020,327\n8 Timbaland: Apologize (feat.

Photo: Jonathan Carroll\nFrom crust to toppings, Terry Durack gets fired up over Sydney\u0027s 10 top pizzas.\nThere is the sort of pizza you eat when you\u0027ve had too much to drink and then there is real pizza: crisp of crust, smelling of wood smoke and herbs, topped with the bright, sweet acidity of tomato and just one or two other colourful and aromatic things. Sydney has always loved its pizza but in recent years the bar has been raised by a whole new breed of perfection-seeking pizzaphiles.\nHere, then, are the city\u0027s finest, in order and based on the type of oven (preferably wood-fired), quality of crust (scorched, bubbled, crisp, dry), integrity of ingredients (seasonal, fresh, appropriate), sheer can\u0027t-stop-eating-it moreishness and a certain lightness of being that translates into digestibility. And please, Sydney, put away your knife and fork. Great pizza is a hand-to-mouth experience. So where do you find Sydney\u0027s top 10 pizzas? Glad you asked.\nView Sydney\u0027s Best Pizzas in a larger map\n1. Lucio Pizzeria\nShop 1, Republic 2 Courtyard, 248 Palmer Street, Darlinghurst. Phone: 9332 3766\nThe wood-fired oven is the heart and soul of this tiny place, tucked into the corner of the courtyard of Republic 2 in Darlinghurst. Yes, that\u0027s right, the spot that used to be Pizza Mario (see No. 2). These days, the keeper of the flame is the handsome Naples-born Lucio de Falco, former pizza maestro of Cammeray\u0027s ristorante/pizzeria Amici. The mainly Italian crowds come for the impressive antipasti platters of arancini, perfect little fried pizzette and, of course, for the pizza. Lucio\u0027s pizza is truly Neapolitan in style: the yeasts fully developed, the cooking fast and the heat high to achieve that soft-but-crisp, puffed-up, cooked-through crust fragrant with wood-ash and pocked with bubbles. His skills get a workout with the signature Pizza Lucio ($18), a clever combination of the Margherita and ham-and-ricotta-filled calzone.\nBeyond pizza: You can start with a glass of seriously good prosecco, then finish with a golden limoncello.\n2. Pizza Mario\nSt Margaret\u0027s, Ivy Shop 9, 417-421 Bourke Street, Surry Hills. Phone: 9332 3633\nTucked away in a windy courtyard, Mario\u0027s is a place of worship for Sydney\u0027s pizza faithful. An accredited member of Italy\u0027s Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, owner and pizzaiolo David Cowdrill is a true defender of the Neapolitan style. This means the dough is shaped only with the hands; the oven is wood-burning; the pizza is cooked directly on the oven floor; the crust is soft, well-cooked and fragrant; and the toppings are \"not in conflict with the rules of gastronomy\". The result is purist pizza - crusty, puffy, not overloaded with toppings and designed to be eaten in the hand. The Margherita Extra (buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, fresh tomato, basil, $25) is the city\u0027s benchmark and the Patate (potato, sea salt, rosemary, $14) is simplicity itself.\nBeyond pizza: Check the blackboard for seasonal specials such as figs and prosciutto or golden deep-fried gamberetti (school prawns).\n3. Cavallino\ncorner McCarrs Creek Road and Yulong Avenue, Terrey Hills. Phone: 9450 1777\nThese days, the residents of Terrey Hills tend to walk around with smug, self-satisfied smiles on their faces. The reason for this is the recent arrival of Cavallino - part pizzeria, part bar and part ristorante with the air of an Italian hunting lodge - set up by Giovanni Pilu of Pilu at Freshwater and Ventuno founder Lido Russo. The pizza oven takes centre stage, fringed by a horseshoe bar that gives the chosen few a ringside view of the Sardinian pizza chefs in action. The end result of their twirling is a pizza with a golden, crisp, lightly scorched cornicione (crust). There are 16 in all, including the much-ordered Naia - a Margherita topped with hot chips ($19). Yes, chips.\nBeyond pizza: The sliced-to-order salumi, including locally made Quattro Stelle salami, are worth a visit in their own right.\n4. Rosso Pomodoro\nShop 90-91, 24 Buchanan Street, Balmain. Phone: 9555 5924\nWe love The Rules. Hardened regulars at this modest little establishment tucked away in White Bay already know them by heart but for newcomers, they are framed and hanging on the wall. \"No half and half. No ham and pineapple. Only Italian mozzarella. Only Italian toppings. No corkage. Italian-certified pizza-maker. Pizza cooked straight on the stone.\" Well, that\u0027s settled then. The oven might be electric but the pizzas have the kind of rustic charm and lightly chewy crust that usually only come with wood and smoke. The big order is the Rocco (tomato, mozzarella, rocket, prosciutto, shaved parmesan, $23) but if you\u0027re after a \"white\" pizza, the Patate e Salsiccia (mozzarella, Italian sausage, potato, rosemary, $21) is a treat, the paper-thin slices of unpeeled potato adding a wonderfully earthy note.\nBeyond pizza: The unremittingly cheerful staff turn the joint into an impromptu pizza party most nights.\n5. La Disfida\n109 Ramsay Street, Haberfield. Phone: 9798 8299\nAfter helping lead Sydney out of the pizza dark ages for the past 16 years, local wood-fired pioneer Ruggiero Lattanzio has hung up his pizza paddle. That\u0027s the bad news. The good news is that Peter Zuzza, whose family ran Glebe\u0027s legendary Mixing Pot restaurant for 25 years, has taken over La Disfida. While he has spruced the place up a bit and built up the menu, the pizza remains sacrosanct - Zuzza and his pizza chef went through rigorous training sessions with Lattanzio. So the base is still elegantly thin, the crust still light and bubbly and the topping still fresh-tasting. All the old favourites - Napoli ($22), Margherita ($22) and the popular Disfida topped with tomato, mozzarella, ham, smoked mozzarella, olives and anchovies ($22) - are not only present but correct.\nBeyond pizza: It\u0027s worth dining in for the Italian-accented wine list.\n6. Pompei\u0027s\n126-130 Roscoe Street, Bondi Beach. Phone: 9365 1233\nGeorge Pompei\u0027s parents might have come from northern Italy, a fair trek from pizza\u0027s southern-Italian heartland, but this hasn\u0027t stopped him from becoming one of our most dedicated and knowledgeable pizza proponents. At his popular indoor/outdoor corner cafe, all pizze are made with stone-ground, unbleached flour, extra virgin olive oil, natural yeast and sea salt, with the dough proved for 36 hours. Crusts are thin and lightly puffy and toppings are simple, seasonal and correctly layered. Surprisingly, for someone so finicky, Pompei decided against a wood-fired oven, preferring the control and precision of electric. There are 25 pizzas, including an Oberhammer of pancetta, mascarpone, mushrooms, tomato and fior di latte ($21.20).\nBeyond pizza: The gelato is as artisanal, freshly made and seasonally adjusted as the pizza. Go for the dark chocolate (70 per cent Amedei) and swoon.\n7. Ventuno\n21 Hickson Road, Walsh Bay. Phone: 9247 4444\nThe Tricolore pizza here ($25) would have to be the prettiest pizza in Sydney, with its fresh, bright, flag-waving combination of cherry tomatoes, mozzarella and rocket. It\u0027s much-loved by theatre-lovers before\na show at the nearby Sydney Theatre Company. Opened by Bacino Bar supremo Lido Russo in 2007, Ventuno is one of the few places in Sydney where you can eat a proper, wood-fired pizza alfresco, complete with Italian attitude and accent, at the water\u0027s edge. Roberto Taffuri, the pizzaiolo, turns out a good, thin, uniform crust with just the right amount of scorch. \"The flour,\" he says, \"is the most important thing.\"\nBeyond pizza: Ventuno has its own private marina berth, so you can come by boat if it isn\u0027t more than 18 metres (sorry, James Packer).\n8. AgapÃ© Organic Restaurant\n1385 Botany Road, Botany. Phone: 8668 5777\nPizza? Healthy? AgapÃ©\u0027s owner and chef, Simon Lawson, is out to prove the two words aren\u0027t mutually exclusive. To prove his point, he has set up a pioneering organic restaurant featuring a range of pizzas made from spelt, a primitive grain and distant cousin to modern wheat that is more easily digestible and has a higher protein content. The result is a clean-tasting, light pizza that feels as if it\u0027s doing you good, while at the same time satisfies your more basic pizza urges. While not wood-fired, the electric oven\u0027s heat is intense enough to cook a pizza in two minutes, which also aids digestibility. Vegetarians generally go for the pumpkin, pesto, spinach, feta and caramelised onion pizza ($23), while meat-eaters prefer the chorizo, smoked eggplant and roast peppers ($23).\nBeyond pizza: The all-organic menu showcases spelt and other ancient grains such as amaranth and quinoa.\n9. Love Supreme\n180 Oxford Street, Paddington. Phone: 9331 1779\nIs this Sydney\u0027s hottest pizza joint? Vlad and Bosko Vujovic, formerly of the much-loved Arthur\u0027s Pizza, have returned to their old stomping ground to dispense \"emotional pizza for one and all\". It\u0027s cosy, dimly lit and packed solid with Paddington\u0027s coolest crowd, who manoeuvre themselves with ease around towers of takeaway cartons, flour sacks and bags of organic onions. This is the best of Sydney\u0027s \"fashion pizza\". It might be too model-thin and super-crisp to pass any stringent Italian definitions but the integrity and glamour of the toppings win your heart. The delicious Love Supreme pizza of artichoke hearts, buffalo mozza, anchovies and gremolata ($25.90/large) tastes even better when you learn most of the produce is organic and biodynamic.\nBeyond pizza: Mmm, warm mixed olives to share while you wait for your pizza.\n10. Fourth Village Providore\n5A Vista Street, Mosman. Phone: 9960 7168\nPeter and Annette Quattroville initially opened Fourth Village as a beautifully stocked food store and greengrocer. Within a couple of months, they had added a restaurant, with Italian chefs, a wood-fired pizza oven and fine olives and olive oils sourced from the Quattrovilles\u0027 own Hunter Valley olive grove (they also make the restaurant\u0027s house wines). By day, the restaurant is full of Mosman mums; at night, tables are scattered throughout the closed food store, giving it a rustic market feel. Their ultra-crisp, thin-based pizza is the order of the day (and night) with 19 varieties on offer, from good old Margherita ($18) to the Gaella (minted potato, roasted pumpkin, Spanish onion, ricotta, cracked pepper, $22).\nBeyond pizza: At lunchtime, it\u0027s very handy being able to stock up for your next meal just after finishing your last.\nSource: the (sydney) magazine - April issue out now\nHave we missed your favourite pizza joint?

Write a review\nREVIEWED BY JASON BLAKE\nMarch 19, 2010\nReader Reviews 2\nIntense ... Leeanna Walsman and Socratis Otto, locked in a suffocating embrace. Photo: Brett Boardman\nReader rating:\nRating: 3 out of 5 stars\n(17                         votes)\nGenre\nTheatre\nTHERE\u0027S a  website called Unhappy Hipsters that pokes fun at the minimalist chic celebrated in Dwell magazine with piquant captions: \u0027\u0027There are certain sacrifices one has to make when choosing a designer environ,\u0027\u0027 reads one. \u0027\u0027The ability to comfortably recline tops the list.\u0027\u0027\nFor its first few minutes, at least, the writer Bryony Lavery\u0027s Stockholm treads similar territory, gently roasting a stylish young couple, Todd and Kali, for their love of all things Swedish - a love that puts Bergman\u0027s films, Ekstrom\u0027s chairs and Smeg appliances on the one pedestal.\nThey speak Ikean. Just the accent turns them on.\nBut their shared love of surfaces is more than just, well, surface. It goes way deep. \u0027\u0027He likes her intensity,\u0027\u0027  Kali reports. \u0027\u0027She likes that he likes her intensity. It\u0027s something she\u0027s been working on.\u0027\u0027\nNow they are planning a holiday to Stockholm, the city that fires their aesthetic ambitions and, by virtue of the psychological syndrome that bears its name, describes their mutually destructive relationship. From here, Stockholm morphs into something akin to another Swedish icon, August Strindberg\u0027s Dance of Death, with Todd and Kali locked in a suffocating embrace of jealousy, recrimination and violence.\nLavery\u0027s script is smart and sinewy and the actors Socratis Otto and Leeanna Walsman maintain a strong grip on it. Their ramping up of the tension that discharges in the play\u0027s pivotal argument is riveting. The remorseful comedown, played on a precariously tilted bed, is poignantly described.\nThere is a strong dance element in this production directed and choreographed by Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett of the British company Frantic Assembly. It is here that Otto and Walsman look less secure.\nThe movement sequences are difficult.   Few concessions are  made to the fact that they are being performed by non-dancers. Precision and timing are important: a tap kicked on by a flying foot, a swinging leg just clearing a champagne glass.\nOtto and Walsman get through it by the skin of their teeth and, on opening night, the skin of Otto\u0027s knees. They excel in an erotic carve-up with knives and forks that illuminates the all-consuming nature of the relationship but they look hard-pressed at times, juggling the choreographic and emotional demands of the scene.\nSydney Theatre Company Wharf 1, March 17 until April 24\nReader Reviews\n2 reviews so far\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars\nThis play shows the paradox of modern life and relationships. The public face which is in tact and visible and has all the outward signs of sucess covered and ticked. It\u0027s power lies in the gradual subtle disintegration of this facade in writing which is taut and multi layered. The physicality of the relationship which is at first benign begins to warp into an expectation of violence which is increasingly unerving to watch.Though at times as an audience member you become aware of the complexity of the choreography-just how can they do that slow dance on a table top and not fall off-personally I felt the breaks in it being absolutely fluid movement added to the text and my slight anxiety that something would perhaps go awry meant I could not settle comfortably in my seat and be detached\nThere is complicity of the couple in the ritual of violence. It is a cycle which has been repeated over and over .Utterly addictive and inescapable because of the pay off. Even the tenderness of the scene in the bed has the sense of physical risk and there is a rebuilding of their image of their relationship that is presented to the world and to each other at the end of the play. Though not stated as such it is made clear that the outside is not welcome in the hidden core\nThere is utter remorse and therefore the possible redemption of forgiveness however strange the the way this point is reached.\nEvelyn Duke - March 19, 2010, 10:41PM\nRating: 2 out of 5 stars\nStockholm opens with stilted dialogue and it\u0027s a sign of things to come. There is not much to assist the actors who make valiant attempts to bring warmth, lightness and life to a script and production that is as lifeless as the minimalist kitchen set.\nI\u0027m still trying to understand why I should be interested in a middle class young couple who get off on physical violence and end it with hot sex? Major yawn fest!\nThe couple in question are Todd and Kali, a 30 something collective who live in an inner city warehouse cum modern apartment with must have retro appliances. It\u0027s Todd\u0027s birthday and the eve of their holiday to Stockholm when Kali finds a missed call from a woman Louise on Tod\u0027s phone. Her mind runs wild with jealousy and she lashes out physically on Tod. But Othello, this \u0027aint! I just found it difficult to care about them. Jealousy was not a monster but an aphrodisiac it seems and they hop into bed. The bed is raised and they are hanging from harnesses set in the matress. What could have been an exciting, passionate sequence of choreography was very flaccid indeed.\nIt was always filled with moments that were almost exciting and alive, but then just dropped back to a boring middle class domestic drama. But nothing could save it as essentially the story and the production does not excite the audiences imagination. But perhaps that is what we have come to accept and perhaps we are all complicit in the creation of all things mundane.\nJoshua Taylor | Sydney             - March 24, 2010, 4:14PM\nWould you like to write a review?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

Viking boy Hiccup and dragon Toothless form a beautiful friendship in the film adaptation of Cressida Cowellâ€™s books.\nReviewer rating:\nRating: 3 out of 5 stars\nReader rating:\nRating: 4 out of 5 stars\n(12                         votes)\nGenre\nAnimation\nRunning time\n97 min\nActors\nJay Baruchel , America Ferrera , Gerard Butler\nDirector\nDean DeBlois, Chris Sanders\nScreen writer\nWill Davies, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders\nOFLC rating\nPG\nYear\n2010\nLanguage\nEnglish\nHICCUP Horrendous Haddock the Third, the Hope and Heir to the tribe of the Hairy Hooligans, has been Hollywoodised in How to Train Your Dragon. He\u0027s in 3D, with a much smoother look that befits a principal boy in a  studio animation, and only one part of his impressive name in use.\nHiccup the boy Viking, growing up on the Scottish island of Berk, is a bit of a weed in Cressida Cowell\u0027s charming books, a skinny disappointment to his father, Stoick the Vast, Chief of the Hairy Hooligans. To the boys in his class, he\u0027s useless, even if he is the chief\u0027s son.\nThe book\u0027s illustrations, rough monochrome scrawls on the side of the page, show a boy with a piggy snout and doleful eyes who is used to being miserable. Cowell\u0027s writing is warm, witty and satirical and gives a sense of a modern boy\u0027s dilemmas in an ancient world, where everyone but he is huge and hairy and brave.\nThere\u0027s a touch of J.K. Rowling\u0027s Harry Potter books but also the Nigel Molesworth books written by Geoffrey Willans in the 1950s.\nCowell grew up in London, with summer visits to a family cottage on an otherwise deserted Scottish island. Her father told her stories of the Vikings and the dragons that lived in the cliffs.\nThis last bit is the reason for the movie. Dragons mean flight, and Hollywood animators are desperate for stories that make full use of the capabilities of 3D computer animation.\nSo it is that HTTYD features some thrilling flying sequences that make the movie enormous fun. In between, it\u0027s less distinguished, partly because of the hybridisation. Big Hollywood rarely respects the national characteristics of a popular book, unless the author is too powerful to argue with (like Rowling).\nThe directors would no doubt say they do respect the original; they just correct a few deficiencies, such as the absence of any girls in the team of teenage Vikings. Thus the film adds a love interest for Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) - a spirited warrior wench called Astrid (America Ferrera).\nThe changes are much greater than this gender equalisation, though. The tropes of Hollywood animation are so deeply embedded that it is almost second nature to deculture offshore stories, in ways that subtly undermine the very qualities they liked in the original. Behind that is the fear that no one in America will \u0027\u0027get it\u0027\u0027, regardless of what \u0027\u0027it\u0027\u0027 is.\nThus, the world of the adult Vikings is more like the one created by Cowell, but the world of the teenagers is tailored so that an American kid will recognise it.  Stoick the Vast may speak in a broad Scottish accent (Gerard Butler) but the Viking children are junior school brats with smart mouths and attitude. Ho hum.\nWhat saves the movie is the principal dragon, whose nickname is Toothless. He\u0027s sleek, black and powerful, with extraordinarily expressive eyes and a real sense of  grandeur.\nHiccup finds him in the forest, wounded and unable to fly properly. After they learn to trust each other, it becomes a story of a beautiful friendship.\nToothless is not too cartoony or too cute. He\u0027s a wild thing but with a playful side. The animators have done superb work in a dramatic as well as a technical sense.\nThe dragon may be mythical but he stands in for all of the natural world, as a misunderstood creature that humans have long abused.\nThe moral, of course, is that it\u0027s not the dragons that need to be tamed.\nLike a lot of recent studio animations, this one is a bit scary in parts, so it may not suit the very young.\nReader Reviews\nBe the first to write a review.\nWould you like to write a review?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth.\nReviewer rating:\nRating: 1 out of 5 stars\nReader rating:\nRating: 2 out of 5 stars\n(27                         votes)\nGenre\nRomance\nRunning time\n107 min\nActors\nMiley Cyrus , Liam Hemsworth , Greg Kinnear , Kelly Preston\nDirector\nJulie Anne Robinson\nScreen writer\nNicholas Sparks and Jeff van Wie\nOFLC rating\nPG\nYear\n2010\nLanguage\nEnglish\nDISNEY has decided it\u0027s time Miley Cyrus, the darling of its preteen TV audience,  swam in the mainstream. So we have The Last Song, in which she abandons her TV alter ego, Hannah Montana, and pouts as a rebellious teen.\nHer hapless father is Greg Kinnear, an actor whose smooth-skinned boyishness, blue eyes and quizzical smile make him a natural casting for characters put upon by difficult people. His eternal affability tends to be an irritant they just can\u0027t take and Cyrus\u0027s Ronnie Miller is in just such a state when she and her young brother, Jonah (Bobby Coleman), come to spend the summer with him.\nYears earlier, Kinnear\u0027s Steve Miller walked out  for reasons yet to be revealed. His ex-wife (Kelly Preston) has long since forgiven him, as has Jonah. But Ronnie  still nurses a grudge so large that Cyrus\u0027s pout morphs into a sneer whenever she shares a scene with him. It\u0027s a sour start but we know  things are bound to sweeten up soon.\nStrictly generic ... the romance follows the usual pattern.\nThe screenplay is by Nicholas Sparks who regularly turns out sentimental bestsellers. Dear John, The Notebook and Nights in Rodanthe are  examples of his familiarity with the workings of the tear duct.\nOn Tybee Island, just off the coast near Savannah, Georgia, Steve lives in a cottage which the film\u0027s designers have fondly weathered in shabby chic style. It even incorporates a studio where Steve is making a stained glass window for the local church but the house\u0027s centrepiece is a piano. He is a classically trained composer and before the family split, Ronnie was his  protege.\nNow, however, she\u0027s saying no to music along with everything else. She\u0027s about to decline a scholarship to Juilliard and - even more radical - she gets halfway through the film before singing her latest single.\nI suppose it\u0027s a stretch to ask for an original twist or two in a machine-made movie like this but the director, Julie Anne Robinson, and her crew have taken such pains in pinpointing Tybee Island as their setting that a whiff of authenticity would have been nice. But no, their approach is strictly generic.\nWe\u0027re revisiting that teen movie shrine, A Summer Place, where the sea glitters and first kisses are exchanged on balmy evenings amid lengthening shadows. Ronnie comes across her summer love as soon as she steps on to the sand.\nHe\u0027s playing volleyball and he knocks her over, which I suppose qualifies as meeting cute. His name is Will, he\u0027s played by Australian actor Liam Hemsworth and he has it all. As well as the good looks and perfect physique, he has enough discernment to decide outsider Ronnie is more interesting than the blonde princesses pursuing him.\nOnce that discovery is out of the way, we\u0027re quickly into those mood montages romcom makers prefer these days because they do away with the need for snappy dialogue.\nOtherwise, the romance follows the usual pattern with a hiccup in the middle before the upbeat ending. Since this is a Sparks movie, there\u0027s a weepy section where father and daughter realise that they\u0027re kindred spirits after all.\nIt\u0027s not one of Sparks\u0027s more inventive efforts and Cyrus\u0027s extended sulk doesn\u0027t exactly enhance her acting prospects. Not that this means much.\nThe only question that matters to Cyrus and Disney is whether her fans  can say goodbye to Hannah Montana.\nReader Reviews\nBe the first to write a review.\nWould you like to write a review?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

However, the so-called \u0027\u0027porn king\u0027\u0027 Con Ange, with whom she previously formed a weight-loss venture, Pharmaslim, is nowhere in sight. Chikarovski has started a new company, Chika Health, which is set to announce its first product - a \u0027\u0027supplement\u0027\u0027 called Supprexxa - next month. \u0027\u0027Like a lot of women her age, she recently began to put on weight and was missing the kind of energy that she had sustained during her political career,\u0027\u0027 a press release, complete with a picture demonstrating again the Liberal liking for Lycra, left, explains. Apparently, Chika\u0027s eureka moment came when she recognised that \u0027\u0027if you get your metabolism and energy levels right, you\u0027re not craving sugar all the time and it\u0027s much easier to lose weight\u0027\u0027. But she says it has nothing to do with her previous partnership with Ange, who runs a chain of adult shops: \u0027\u0027That never came to anything. This is me on my lonesome.\u0027\u0027 Working with naturopaths, the woman best known for rolling Peter Collins as the leader of the Liberals just weeks out from the 1999 election says she has developed a natural product that fills a gap in the market for women aged 40 and over. There are also plans for new products, some targeting men, in the works.\nMATHS REVISION\nThe NSW government\u0027s famously inadequate funding submission to Rod Eddington\u0027s Infrastructure Australia appears to have focused the minds of Treasury officials. One of the key criticisms of the submission - which was viewed as by far the worst of all the states - was its lack of cost-benefit detail for the projects it was seeking funding for, including the metro system. So it is entirely appropriate that Treasury\u0027s website is carrying an advertisement for a series of two-day cost-benefit analysis workshops run by the Institute of Public Administration NSW. Each workshop, for about $1,000 a head, \u0027\u0027covers the principles and practice of cost benefit analysis (CBA),\u0027\u0027 according to the blurb, and includes \u0027\u0027basic and more advanced concepts and practical case studies\u0027\u0027.\nVANISHING SPECIES\nArtistic depictions of the Manly long-nosed bandicoot appear to be as endangered as their real-life counterparts. Manly Council has confirmed that a 15-centimetre sculpture of the animal, which is listed under the NSW Threatened Species Act, is the most recent artwork to disappear from the rocks between Manly and Shelly beaches on the Cabbage Tree Bay eco-sculpture walk. The council estimates that it would cost \u0027\u0027in the thousands\u0027\u0027 to replace the bandicoot artwork as well as a number of smaller snail sculptures by the artist Tim Johnman that have also gone missing from the area, which was declared a \u0027\u0027No Take\u0027\u0027 Aquatic Reserve in 2002. A council spokeswoman conceded that it would need to look at new ways to protect the works, but it might pay to tweak the walk information brochure, for a start. The guide lists threats to Manly\u0027s bandicoot population as \u0027\u0027attacks from dogs, cats and foxes, car accidents and loss of habitat, shelter and food through urban development\u0027\u0027, but there\u0027s absolutely no mention of art lovers.\nGREEN SHOOTS\nTony AbbottÂ might have declared that climate change is \u0027\u0027crap\u0027\u0027, but his shadow treasurer, Joe Hockey, is doing his best to keep a green tinge to his public image. Hockey is due to host a discussion with business types at the Establishment Hotel on \u0027\u0027winning at sustainability\u0027\u0027. The flyer spruiking the event says that \u0027\u0027corporate sustainability goes far beyond merely reducing CO\n2 emissions\u0027\u0027. In fact, in a faint echo of Kevin Rudd\u0027s famous line that climate change was the greatest moral challenge of our time, it describes sustainability as \u0027\u0027the biggest issue facing Australian businesses\u0027\u0027.\nGOT A TIP? Contact diary@smh.com.au or 92822179\nA BIG DAY FOR EDMUND CAPON\nTHE Art Gallery of NSW\u0027s director will oversee the week\u0027s biggest media circus when the winner of the Archibald Prize is announced today. While he has kept a watchful eye on the country\u0027s richest portraiture prize since 1978, Capon also knows what it is like to be on the other side of the canvas (or, ahem, the newspaper caricature). A previous Archibald winner, Adam Cullen, painted the gallery\u0027s chief curator in 2006. And Capon\u0027s melting features in that work are not the only indication that flattery won\u0027t necessarily secure you wallspace. Cullen\u0027s portrait was reportedly the first time Capon\u0027s image made it into the exhibition, despite featuring on the canvases of hopeful artists many times before.\nSTAY IN TOUCH...\nWITH A PM GONE MISSING AT THE ARCHYS\nFORGET the worm - one of the more irreverent barometers of public opinion has some bad news for Kevin Rudd. For the first time in a long time, the serving Prime Minister has not featured among the entries for this year\u0027s alternative Archibald, the Bald Archy Prize. \u0027\u0027When John Howard was prime minister we\u0027d get them by the dozen,\u0027\u0027 said the award\u0027s founder, Peter Batey. \u0027\u0027That has always been the way since we started with Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.\u0027\u0027 But after a series of glowing depictions around his 2007 election win and a few less flattering takes last year, Rudd was the chosen subject in only one work for the 2010 award. And that was rejected. But as one muse falls, another rises. Almost 40 works featuring the Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott, were received. Nine made it into the final exhibition, to open after the winner is announced next Thursday. Even in the era of Pauline Hanson, no public figure has ever been so popular, notes Batey. But Canberra artist Val Johnson\u0027s Are We There Yet?Â  does make one small concession to KRudd in her depiction of Abbott. The Queenslander\u0027s head has been squeezed onto the banana carried aloft by Howard.\nWITH OUT-OF-VOGUE COMMENTS\nTHANKS to all that botox in the room it was impossible to tell which fashionista had nodded off during last week\u0027s fashion business seminar at the Melbourne Fashion Festival, a sort of international think tank on hemlines, the APEC of shoulder pads.\nPerhaps the editor of Vogue Australia, Kirstie Clements,Â  is now wishing she had slept through it after what she calls a \u0027\u0027throwaway\u0027\u0027 comment triggered an international scandal. She was reported to have told the gathering, including the head designer of Calvin Klein, that she censored any critical comments of designers on the magazine\u0027s online forums.\nThe initial report was via a Tweet from the fashion blogger Patty Huntington, who also aired Clements\u0027s comments in a report she wrote for the US publication Women\u0027s Wear Daily. This was regurgitated in the magazine New York under the rather unedifying headline: \u0027\u0027Australian Vogue deletes negative comments about advertisers from its site\u0027\u0027.\nWhile Planet Vogue\u0027s high priestess Anna Wintour would no doubt be proud of Clements\u0027s business acumen, Clements said yesterday that the reports were way off the mark . \u0027\u0027We moderate for all sorts of things, from cyberbullying to people being malicious and vindictive,\u0027\u0027 she said of the website, which attracts more than a million unique visitors a month, many of whom go into the forums. \u0027\u0027It certainly is not censorship because our forums are full of people making their points, both favourable and not â€¦ we moderate only when the commentary is counterproductive or defamatory.\u0027\u0027\nSadly for Clements, no one was moderating unsavoury comments being made by New York magazine\u0027s readers yesterday, such as Fashionlaydee, who wrote: \u0027\u0027Australian Vogue is a contradiction in terms.\u0027\u0027\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 234 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 258 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 172 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 98 people read this\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ... 100 people read this\nTop National articles\nAbbott softens stance on gays\nAbbott dumps Joyce as finance spokesman\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ABS\nSpicy sauce to punish children\nAbbott throws Joyce into fight over water use\nMore National articles\nNational Topics\nPlacesExpand (24095)\nAll Places (24095)\nSydney (10912)\nMelbourne (6281)\nVictoria (3093)\nAdelaide (2360)\nACT (2240)\nCanberra (2197)\nPerth (1876)\nWestern Australia (1246)\nNewcastle (1094)\nSouth Australia (1091)\nTasmania (831)\nGeelong (814)\nNorthern Territory (671)\nDarwin (531)\nHobart (435)\nWollongong (355)\nChristmas Island (289)\nNew South Wales (204)\nAlice Springs (172)\nLaunceston (155)\nBallarat (134)\nByron Bay (67)\nBroome (57)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (16112)\nAll People (16112)\nKevin Rudd (2523)\nMalcolm Turnbull (1147)\nTony Abbott (901)\nNathan Rees (800)\nJulia Gillard (704)\nWayne Swan (613)\nNicola Roxon (429)\nJohn Brumby (388)\nJoe Hockey (388)\nJohn Howard (382)\nStephen Smith (356)\nPeter Garrett (336)\nPenny Wong (270)\nNick Xenophon (257)\nBarnaby Joyce (254)\nSteve Fielding (230)\nBob Brown (223)\nPeter Costello (206)\nAnthony Albanese (197)\nChris Evans (191)\nJenny Macklin (186)\nLindsay Tanner (177)\nJohn Faulkner (175)\nMike Rann (174)\nNick Minchin (172)\nJulie Bishop (171)\nStephen Conroy (147)\nRobert McClelland (140)\nPaul Keating (119)\nChristopher Pyne (117)\nColin Barnett (110)\nJoel Fitzgibbon (106)\nSimon Crean (102)\nGreg Hunt (101)\nTony Burke (97)\nSharman Stone (87)\nIan Macfarlane (83)\nBob Hawke (82)\nKim Carr (74)\nMartin Ferguson (72)\nChristine Milne (71)\nAndrew Robb (70)\nWarren Truss (69)\nPaul Henderson (63)\nDavid Bartlett (54)\nGeorge Pell (44)\nJoe Ludwig (41)\nGough Whitlam (39)\nMalcolm Fraser (36)\nMick Keelty (35)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4857)\nAll Organisations (4857)\nLiberal Party (718)\nThe Greens (539)\nReserve Bank of Australia (524)\nFederal Police (470)\nLabor Party (470)\nFederal Court (303)\nMedicare (261)\nNational Party (231)\nFamily First (216)\nHigh Court (207)\nLifeline (178)\nACTU (152)\nACCC (113)\nCSIRO (106)\nAustralian Customs (104)\nRSPCA (67)\nAustralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (64)\nASIO (62)\nSalvation Army (60)\nFamily Court (60)\nCFMEU (56)\nAustralian Workers Union (43)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nNational News Video More video\nPolice close in on Oakleigh rioters\nVideo footage uploaded on the internet by crowd members at the Oakleigh riots is helping police close in on the rioters.\nPlay video\nFears ease as Ului slips away\nPlay video\nRampaging car fans riot in Oakleigh\nPlay video\nThree car crash outside ambulance branch\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?

Photo: Domino Postiglione\nBARNABY JOYCE has been ousted from the finance portfolio and Malcolm Turnbull snubbed in an opposition frontbench reshuffle. Andrew Robb has returned to shadow cabinet and been given control of spending plans.\nThe Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott, bowed to pressure  and used the resignation of Nick Minchin from the shadow cabinet to shuffle Senator Joyce out of finance and put an end to  claims that the colourful Queensland National  was damaging the Coalition\u0027s economic credibility.\nBut the reshuffle failed to dampen government criticism when, as a compromise,  Senator Joyce was given responsibility for water.\nHe does not have a collegiate attitude towards water sharing in the Murray-Darling basin and is an ardent supporter of the giant Cubbie Station cotton farm. The Nationals oppose Mr Abbott\u0027s plan for a referendum on handing control of the river system to the federal government.\nThe Climate Change and Water Minister, Penny Wong, said Mr Abbott had put the fox in charge of the henhouse.\n\"It is unbelievable that the Coalition still hasn\u0027t learnt the lessons of the past 100 years of mismanagement of the Murray-Darling basin,\u0027\u0027 she said.\n\"Senator Joyce is opposed to reducing how much water we take out of the rivers, but everyone knows that the only way we will keep our rivers healthy is by reducing how much water we take out of them.\"\nAfter a series of gaffes and  accusations that he has made reckless economic statements, Senator Joyce was moved to infrastructure and water, and regional development.\nIan Macfarlane will resume responsibility for energy and resources, which he lost to Senator Minchin after Mr Abbott became leader. Mr Macfarlane, like Mr Turnbull, was a strong supporter of the government\u0027s emissions trading scheme.\nMr Robb, who stepped down from the frontbench six months ago to deal with depression, has become the Coalition\u0027s fifth finance spokesman since the  election in 2007.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Turnbull let it be known that he was willing to return to the frontbench, but was overlooked.\nA source close to Mr Abbott said Mr Turnbull\u0027s chances were \u0027\u0027non-existent\u0027\u0027 because any frontbench return would have required him to renounce his support for an ETS and to embrace Mr Abbott\u0027s \u0027\u0027direct action\u0027\u0027 climate change plan.   Mr Turnbull has described the plan as \u0027\u0027bullshit\u0027\u0027.\nMr Abbott said yesterday it would have been \u0027\u0027premature\u0027\u0027 to  bring back Mr Turnbull, given that the ETS legislation was still before  Parliament, but he would offer him \u0027\u0027a senior role\u0027\u0027\u0027 should the Coalition win the election.\nMr Turnbull is yet to announce whether he will recontest his seat of Wentworth at the election but, after yesterday, senior colleagues believed there was less chance of his staying on.\nThe NSW Opposition Leader, Barry O\u0027Farrell, yesterday backed Mr Turnbull\u0027s return to the frontbench.\nMr Abbott refused to concede he had erred by appointing Senator Joyce to finance in the first place. He said Senator Joyce had been unfairly targeted.\n\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t want him to be necessarily chained to a desk costing policies.

He said: \u0027If I hear you speaking about this again anywhere, I\u0027ll see to it you\u0027ll never work in this country again\u0027,\" she told Nine.\nMonahan, who was six when she first played Hughes\u0027 on-screen daughter Jenny Kelly in the Hey Dad! pilot episode, said the allegations against Hughes were known throughout the Australian television industry.\n\"It was such an open secret that when I had left the show ... every audition I went to, people blatantly asked if it was true,\" she told Nine.\n\"That\u0027s how well known it was in the industry. People would come up to me on the street and ask me.\"\nShe said Reilly had asked her whether she wanted to leave the show.\nWhen she said she had to stay because she was her family\u0027s breadwinner, the show\u0027s script was changed so she no longer had to sit on Hughes\u0027 lap or hug him.\nReilly told Nine last week he had no knowledge of the allegations at the time.\nHughes, who now lives in Singapore, has denied all the allegations raised since Monahan\u0027s interview with a women\u0027s magazine almost two weeks ago.\nNine says other women have come forward with similar claims against Hughes and spoke to two unnamed sisters who claimed they were also touched inappropriately by him.\nAAP\nJoin the conversation\n178 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 167 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 179 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 119 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 104 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 123 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nFURTHER allegations have been made about Hey Dad\u0027s Robert Hughes, with ...\nHey Dad! star Hughes denies sex abuse claims\nThe star of one of Australia\u0027s most-loved television shows last night ...\nClick to play video\nVideo\nHey Dad! police statement\nTop National articles\nAbbott softens stance on gays\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ABS\nAbbott dumps Joyce as finance spokesman\nSpicy sauce to punish children\nAbbott throws Joyce into fight over water use\nMore National articles\nNational Topics\nPlacesExpand (24096)\nAll Places (24096)\nSydney (10912)\nMelbourne (6281)\nVictoria (3094)\nAdelaide (2360)\nACT (2240)\nCanberra (2197)\nPerth (1876)\nWestern Australia (1246)\nNewcastle (1094)\nSouth Australia (1091)\nTasmania (831)\nGeelong (814)\nNorthern Territory (671)\nDarwin (531)\nHobart (435)\nWollongong (355)\nChristmas Island (289)\nNew South Wales (204)\nAlice Springs (172)\nLaunceston (155)\nBallarat (134)\nByron Bay (67)\nBroome (57)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (16115)\nAll People (16115)\nKevin Rudd (2523)\nMalcolm Turnbull (1147)\nTony Abbott (902)\nNathan Rees (800)\nJulia Gillard (704)\nWayne Swan (613)\nNicola Roxon (429)\nJohn Brumby (388)\nJoe Hockey (388)\nJohn Howard (382)\nStephen Smith (356)\nPeter Garrett (336)\nPenny Wong (270)\nNick Xenophon (257)\nBarnaby Joyce (254)\nSteve Fielding (230)\nBob Brown (223)\nPeter Costello (206)\nAnthony Albanese (197)\nChris Evans (191)\nJenny Macklin (186)\nLindsay Tanner (177)\nJohn Faulkner (175)\nMike Rann (174)\nNick Minchin (172)\nJulie Bishop (171)\nStephen Conroy (147)\nRobert McClelland (140)\nPaul Keating (119)\nChristopher Pyne (117)\nColin Barnett (109)\nJoel Fitzgibbon (106)\nSimon Crean (102)\nGreg Hunt (101)\nTony Burke (97)\nSharman Stone (87)\nIan Macfarlane (83)\nBob Hawke (82)\nKim Carr (74)\nMartin Ferguson (72)\nChristine Milne (71)\nAndrew Robb (70)\nWarren Truss (69)\nPaul Henderson (63)\nDavid Bartlett (54)\nGeorge Pell (44)\nJoe Ludwig (41)\nGough Whitlam (39)\nMalcolm Fraser (36)\nMick Keelty (35)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4857)\nAll Organisations (4857)\nLiberal Party (718)\nThe Greens (539)\nReserve Bank of Australia (524)\nFederal Police (470)\nLabor Party (470)\nFederal Court (303)\nMedicare (261)\nNational Party (231)\nFamily First (216)\nHigh Court (207)\nLifeline (178)\nACTU (152)\nACCC (113)\nCSIRO (106)\nAustralian Customs (104)\nRSPCA (67)\nAustralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (64)\nASIO (62)\nSalvation Army (60)\nFamily Court (60)\nCFMEU (56)\nAustralian Workers Union (43)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nFURTHER allegations have been made about Hey Dad\u0027s Robert Hughes, with two sisters claiming they had been inappropriately touched by the actor many times in their family home.\nHey Dad! star Hughes denies sex abuse claims\nThe star of one of Australia\u0027s most-loved television shows last night denied claims he had molested a young co-star on the set of the program.\nClick to play video\nVideo\nHey Dad! police statement\nPolice are gathering info about TV dad Robert Hughes, but have not yet heard directly from any alleged victims.\nLatest Video\nNational News Video More video\nPolice close in on Oakleigh rioters\nVideo footage uploaded on the internet by crowd members at the Oakleigh riots is helping police close in on the rioters.\nPlay video\nFears ease as Ului slips away\nPlay video\nRampaging car fans riot in Oakleigh\nPlay video\nThree car crash outside ambulance branch\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?

The world population grew 1.1 per cent in the same period.\nEconomists had expected a slight dip in population growth after the government dropped the number of skilled migrant places in last year\u0027s budget - but the lower quotas have had little effect so far.\nThe population rose by more than the number of people in the Australian Capital Territory in the year to September, increasing by  451,900. And the pace did not slack as the year went on, growing by 110,400 in the three months to  September.\nMigration accounted for the bulk of the increase.\n\u0027\u0027Natural\u0027\u0027 population growth - births less deaths - came to 154,500 for the year, while  migration contributed 297,400 people.\nThe figures feed into a debate about whether the country has the resources and infrastructure  to cope with growing cities.\nA former Labor frontbencher, Kelvin Thomson,  has regularly voiced his concerns about the environmental impact of a more populous Australia.\nHe said the Bureau of Statistics figures represented a \u0027\u0027recipe for environmental devastation, rising interest rates, and unaffordable housing\u0027\u0027.\n\u0027\u0027This is the reason for the 22 per cent decline in housing affordability we saw during 2009 - rising house prices fuelled by demand outstripping supply,\u0027\u0027 Mr Thomson said.\nThe Macquarie Group economist Rory Robertson said the people coming to Australia in recent years had mostly settled in coastal capitals.  \u0027\u0027Obviously there has been a big deal for housing demand and city infrastructure needs.\u0027\u0027\nBut Mr Robertson added: \u0027\u0027Immigration may have peaked for the next few years at least, given that Canberra now is taking a tougher line on foreign students becoming permanent residents, and with the surge in Australians rushing home to escape offshore recessions having peaked.\u0027\u0027\nThe Treasurer, Wayne Swan, will today press state treasurers to agree on timelines to lock in the supply of new housing.\nAt a meeting in Canberra, the treasurers will be under pressure to agree on audits to look at \u0027\u0027underutilised\u0027\u0027 land, and to examine large private holdings of land that could be used to increase the housing stock.\nThe opposition spokesman on housing, Gary Humphries, questioned whether the meeting would achieve anything.\n\u0027\u0027These Labor governments have been pursuing this approach for a decade, and Labor has been in power nationally for more than two years, so what\u0027s Mr Swan doing about this problem?\u0027\u0027\nNSW grew by 1.7 per cent, behind Western Australia at 2.9 per cent, Queensland at 2.7 per cent, the Northern Territory at 2.3 per cent and Victoria at 2.2 per cent.\nJoin the conversation\n39 people are reading this now.\nComment on

punishment and brainwashed them not to call her former husband \u0027\u0027Dad\u0027\u0027 has been ordered by a court to undergo psychological treatment after a judge found her actions had been \u0027\u0027entirely inappropriate\u0027\u0027.\nThe woman, known as Ms Israel, had made an application to the Family Court  seeking her five-year-old son, known as \u0027\u0027M\u0027\u0027, be returned to her after he was removed from her care last December.\nShe and the child\u0027s father, known as Mr Hilder, had separated in 2006 when both shared custody of him.\nJudge Graham Bell said it was \u0027\u0027clear\u0027\u0027  the mother had administered the hot sauce to her children as a form of punishment and that \u0027\u0027M\u0027\u0027 had been subjected to it from the age of three.\nAnother of Ms Israel\u0027s sons  said he found it funny because his stepbrother \u0027\u0027pees his pants and looks very scared\u0027\u0027 when threatened with the punishment.\nThe judge ordered that the child live with his father and that the mother not be allowed to have unsupervised visits with her son until she had undergone appropriate psychological treatment.\nJoin the

The ACCC said the company had agreed to remove claims from its website that the ring had a \"proven history of successful drug-free treatment of snoring\" and was \"tested and recommended by a physician\".\nThe ring is sold at most major chemist and health store chains in Australia, the ACCC said.\nRon Grunstein, a professor of sleep medicine at the Woolcock Institute at the University of Sydney, said he thought it was a problem that pharmacies sold unproven treatments for snoring and insomnia.\nHe saw patients \"all the time\" who had wasted large amounts of money on alternative snoring treatments before seeking medical help. \u0027\u0027No matter how much advice [we give] about these treatments having very little effect, people still get ripped off.\u0027\u0027\nKen Harvey, of La Trobe University,    said the  Therapeutic Goods Administration provided no protection  against devices considered \"low risk\".\n\"Devices that make absolutely crazy claims are doing very well in Australia,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nThe  ACCC   runs regular internet sweeps to catch companies making unproven medical claims.\nAmy Corderoy\nJoin the conversation\n16 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 160 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 96 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 88 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 107 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 86 people read this\nTop National articles\nAbbott softens stance on gays\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ABS\nAbbott dumps Joyce as finance spokesman\nSpicy sauce to punish children\nAbbott throws Joyce into fight over water use\nMore National articles\nNational Topics\nPlacesExpand (24096)\nAll Places (24096)\nSydney (10912)\nMelbourne (6281)\nVictoria (3094)\nAdelaide (2360)\nACT (2241)\nCanberra (2197)\nPerth (1876)\nWestern Australia (1246)\nNewcastle (1094)\nSouth Australia (1091)\nTasmania (831)\nGeelong (814)\nNorthern Territory (671)\nDarwin (531)\nHobart (435)\nWollongong (355)\nChristmas Island (289)\nNew South Wales (204)\nAlice Springs (172)\nLaunceston (155)\nBallarat (134)\nByron Bay (67)\nBroome (57)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (16115)\nAll People (16115)\nKevin Rudd (2523)\nMalcolm Turnbull (1147)\nTony Abbott (902)\nNathan Rees (800)\nJulia Gillard (704)\nWayne Swan (613)\nNicola Roxon (429)\nJohn Brumby (388)\nJoe Hockey (388)\nJohn Howard (382)\nStephen Smith (356)\nPeter Garrett (336)\nPenny Wong (270)\nNick Xenophon (257)\nBarnaby Joyce (254)\nSteve Fielding (230)\nBob Brown (223)\nPeter Costello (206)\nAnthony Albanese (197)\nChris Evans (191)\nJenny Macklin (186)\nLindsay Tanner (177)\nJohn Faulkner (175)\nMike Rann (174)\nNick Minchin (172)\nJulie Bishop (171)\nStephen Conroy (147)\nRobert McClelland (140)\nPaul Keating (119)\nChristopher Pyne (117)\nColin Barnett (109)\nJoel Fitzgibbon (106)\nSimon Crean (102)\nGreg Hunt (101)\nTony Burke (97)\nSharman Stone (87)\nIan Macfarlane (83)\nBob Hawke (82)\nKim Carr (74)\nMartin Ferguson (72)\nChristine Milne (71)\nAndrew Robb (70)\nWarren Truss (69)\nPaul Henderson (63)\nDavid Bartlett (54)\nGeorge Pell (44)\nJoe Ludwig (41)\nGough Whitlam (39)\nMalcolm Fraser (36)\nMick Keelty (35)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4857)\nAll Organisations (4857)\nLiberal Party (718)\nThe Greens (539)\nReserve Bank of Australia (524)\nFederal Police (470)\nLabor Party (470)\nFederal Court (303)\nMedicare (261)\nNational Party (231)\nFamily First (216)\nHigh Court (207)\nLifeline (178)\nACTU (152)\nACCC (113)\nCSIRO (106)\nAustralian Customs (104)\nRSPCA (67)\nAustralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (64)\nASIO (62)\nSalvation Army (60)\nFamily Court (60)\nCFMEU (56)\nAustralian Workers Union (43)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nNational News Video More video\nPolice close in on Oakleigh rioters\nVideo footage uploaded on the internet by crowd members at the Oakleigh riots is helping police close in on the rioters.\nPlay video\nFears ease as Ului slips away\nPlay video\nRampaging car fans riot in Oakleigh\nPlay video\nThree car crash outside ambulance branch\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?

Successive state governments have repeatedly made bold declarations, only to subsequently withdraw them. We\u0027ve had lots of visions, but little money to pay for them.\nComments 22\nMetro is doomed as start delayed\nANDREW CLENNELL\nTHE metro system is dead, with the Keneally government to abandon plans to begin work on the project this year, amid a push from Treasury officials to delay the lines for 20 years.\nFixers twisted metro files\nLINTON BESSER AND ANDREW WEST\nBUREAUCRATS and political fixers inside the state\u0027s transport agencies have altered official reports as part of a widespread government effort to suppress criticism of its controversial $5.3 billion CBD Metro.\nLabor insider deleted key details from metro report\nANDREW WEST AND LINTON BESSER\nA LONG-TIME Labor staffer-turned transport bureaucrat who edited an expert technical report removed material that undermined the case for the controversial CBD Metro.\nCity choking thanks to \u0027transport nirvana\u0027\nROSS GITTINS\nAt our behest, successive state governments have been pursuing a magnificent dream, to make Sydney a place fit for cars to be driven on all occasions.

Our leaders watched car dependency overwhelm a suffocating public transport system and then conspired in turning off the oxygen at seemingly every chance.\nWorld of options with new harbour crossing\nUsing the lower deck of the bridge for carrying commuter trains would create a connected train web.\nOne ruler over all modes of travel\nAn integrated body is needed to make plans and take charge.\nAre the grand plans affordable?\nFunding remains a key barrier to a long-term public transport plan. The capital costs of building the infrastructure canvassed here would probably be of the order of $52 billion, excluding additional operating costs.\nWeighing   East Asian model against   European\nAn effective transport strategy must take account of changing population needs. The study has examined two well-established scenarios.\nMetro: faster, versatile, less comfortable\nCityRail\u0027s eight-carriage double-deck trains can seat about 900 passengers and have a realistic maximum capacity of about 1200.\nHow to help people who live where the trains don\u0027t go\nResponding to density is crucial to providing an integrated service.\nCatch up with the rest of the world\nRECOMMENDATION: Simple, fair and integrated fares without interchange penalties, to be pursued without delay and without waiting, perhaps for years, for \"smartcard\" ticketing.\nNew routes key to a working harbour for commuters\nManly to Bondi Junction?

It struggles [with] a long tail of low achievement,\u0027\u0027 Dr Hill said.\n\u0027\u0027Keeping an eye on that tail so that socio-economic status is less of a predictor [of student performance] is the thing to do.  We need to be clear we have the gap. We need to reduce that gap.\u0027\u0027\nAddressing the findings of a Australian Education Union survey of school principals responding to the My School website, Dr Hill said principals were concerned about the groupings of small rural primary schools with large city high schools in so-called like-school comparisons. Despite their lack of similarity in appearance, size and location, Dr Hill said the index  showed that these schools contained similar students in terms of their academic performance in national literacy and numeracy tests.\nThe Herald has analysed the close correlation between student test results and their index  score for the vast majority of schools.\nA small number of exceptions  identified by the Herald analysis shows that schools that performed well above their index score included selective schools such as James Ruse Agricultural High, North Sydney Girls High, St George Girls High, Hurlstone Agricultural High, North Sydney Boys, Sydney Girls, Sydney Boys and Girraween High.\nPrimary schools that performed significantly above their  ranking included Sydney Grammar preparatory schools, St Francis, Our Lady of the Rosary, Gladstone Public, St Joseph\u0027s Primary, Malek Fahd Islamic School and Wongarbon Public School.\nAnalysis by the NSW Secondary Principals Council casts doubt on the reliability of the index  measures and calls for the use of  student data instead of census data  to measure socio-economic status. It wants a suspension of  comparisons until they can be independently validated and the \u0027\u0027public can be assured that the similarity is accurate, meaningful and comprehensible, rather than simply statistical\u0027\u0027.\nJoin the conversation\n8 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 181 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 123 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 138 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 130 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 246 people read this\nTop National articles\nAbbott softens stance on gays\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ABS\nAbbott dumps Joyce as finance spokesman\nSpicy sauce to punish children\nAbbott throws Joyce into fight over water use\nMore National articles\nNational Topics\nPlacesExpand (24096)\nAll Places (24096)\nSydney (10912)\nMelbourne (6281)\nVictoria (3094)\nAdelaide (2360)\nACT (2241)\nCanberra (2197)\nPerth (1876)\nWestern Australia (1246)\nNewcastle (1094)\nSouth Australia (1091)\nTasmania (831)\nGeelong (814)\nNorthern Territory (671)\nDarwin (531)\nHobart (435)\nWollongong (355)\nChristmas Island (289)\nNew South Wales (204)\nAlice Springs (172)\nLaunceston (155)\nBallarat (134)\nByron Bay (67)\nBroome (57)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (16115)\nAll People (16115)\nKevin Rudd (2523)\nMalcolm Turnbull (1147)\nTony Abbott (902)\nNathan Rees (800)\nJulia Gillard (704)\nWayne Swan (613)\nNicola Roxon (429)\nJohn Brumby (388)\nJoe Hockey (388)\nJohn Howard (382)\nStephen Smith (356)\nPeter Garrett (336)\nPenny Wong (270)\nNick Xenophon (257)\nBarnaby Joyce (254)\nSteve Fielding (230)\nBob Brown (223)\nPeter Costello (206)\nAnthony Albanese (197)\nChris Evans (191)\nJenny Macklin (186)\nLindsay Tanner (177)\nJohn Faulkner (175)\nMike Rann (174)\nNick Minchin (172)\nJulie Bishop (171)\nStephen Conroy (147)\nRobert McClelland (140)\nPaul Keating (119)\nChristopher Pyne (117)\nColin Barnett (109)\nJoel Fitzgibbon (106)\nSimon Crean (102)\nGreg Hunt (101)\nTony Burke (97)\nSharman Stone (87)\nIan Macfarlane (83)\nBob Hawke (82)\nKim Carr (74)\nMartin Ferguson (72)\nChristine Milne (71)\nAndrew Robb (70)\nWarren Truss (69)\nPaul Henderson (63)\nDavid Bartlett (54)\nGeorge Pell (44)\nJoe Ludwig (41)\nGough Whitlam (39)\nMalcolm Fraser (36)\nMick Keelty (35)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4857)\nAll Organisations (4857)\nLiberal Party (718)\nThe Greens (539)\nReserve Bank of Australia (524)\nFederal Police (470)\nLabor Party (470)\nFederal Court (303)\nMedicare (261)\nNational Party (231)\nFamily First (216)\nHigh Court (207)\nLifeline (178)\nACTU (152)\nACCC (113)\nCSIRO (106)\nAustralian Customs (104)\nRSPCA (67)\nAustralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (64)\nASIO (62)\nSalvation Army (60)\nFamily Court (60)\nCFMEU (56)\nAustralian Workers Union (43)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nNational News Video More video\nPolice close in on Oakleigh rioters\nVideo footage uploaded on the internet by crowd members at the Oakleigh riots is helping police close in on the rioters.\nPlay video\nFears ease as Ului slips away\nPlay video\nRampaging car fans riot in Oakleigh\nPlay video\nThree car crash outside ambulance branch\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?  ...\nMore blogs Â« Prev | Next Â»\nComments\nLatest Comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers  ...\nMore comments Â« Prev | Next Â»\nLatest\nFeatured Products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nMore products Â« Prev | Next Â»\nNews\nLatest News\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nImagine being able to read over 10,000 pages in  ...\nMore news Â« Prev | Next Â»\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

This is not a frivolous comment but a sincere question from one who knows people who wish to do so, but whose families are worried about their future family life.\nMARCH 25\nLots of talk but our system is still not very well\nIn Tuesday\u0027s health debate Tony Abbott accused Kevin Rudd of lying to the public. Before making such statements Mr Abbott perhaps needs to clean up his act.\nMARCH 24\nReforms at grave risk on the operating table\nAfter watching the debate between Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott I am even more convinced that the health issues will remain unsolved. Having worked in health informatics in Sydney teaching hospitals, I believe the three C\u0027s of communication, community and casemix will cause the government\u0027s plan to falter.\nMarch 23\nIf this was by the book, it\u0027s time to rewrite the book\nHigh-speed police pursuits belong in movies, not on public roads (\u0027\u0027Fury as family dies after high-speed police chase\u0027\u0027, March 22). How many more innocent people are going to die before this unjustifiable practice is stopped? Surely it is better that a car thief escapes, probably only for a few hours or days, than to jeopardise the lives of anyone who happens to be in the way.\nMarch 22\nOn your bike ... but don\u0027t forget the bodyguard\nThe fact that the Premier, Kristina Keneally, receives police protection as she cycles to work is an indication of how dangerous it is to take to the road in Sydney on a bike (\u0027\u0027Dream ride, but cycling still faces uphill battle\u0027\u0027, March 20-21).\nMarch 20\nKeeping it local: councils write their own rules\nWhenever attempts are made to amalgamate councils we are told vociferously that local government must remain \u0027\u0027close to the people\u0027\u0027 and be able to reflect the wishes and lifestyle of those in each local area.\nMARCH 19\nReligion comparison hasn\u0027t got a leg to stand on\nBarry Lee (Letters, March 18), that we don\u0027t test chairs before we sit in them would seem to suggest that chairs fail to support people a good deal less than gods do. Perhaps if chairs showed a similar and suspiciously indifferent attitude to keeping us that few feet closer to heaven it would indeed result in praying for safe carriage of our behinds through the trials of a lunch burrito.\nMARCH 18\nA debate that puts faith and logic to the test\nLaurie McGinness (Letters, March 17) may find it convenient to place faith and reason in mutually exclusive categories, but the traditional definitions of the two words imply no such thing. For me, becoming a Christian was never a blind, unreasoning \u0027\u0027leap in the dark\u0027\u0027, but a step based on weighing up the evidence.\nMARCH 17\nAcknowledgment a token of good manners\nEvery time Tony Abbott goes to Mass, does he not make the same invocations and acknowledgments week after week, month after month, year after year (\u0027\u0027Welcome to country \u0027tokenistic\u0027 for Labor\u0027\u0027, March 16)?\nMarch 16\nReasoned arguments needed, not insults\nIt seems that when their argument fails to convince, atheists turn to personal abuse and hyperbole. The Pope is a Nazi, Steve Fielding is less intelligent than an earthworm and sophisticated theologians are no better than fundamentalist wingnuts because they \u0027\u0027get doctors to provide testimony that someone was cured from cancer\u0027\u0027 (\u0027\u0027Dawkins derides sainthood as Pythonesque\u0027\u0027, March 15).\nMarch 15\nDrastic changes needed to break vicious cycle\nWho among us did not know that Sydney drivers are among the most aggressive on the planet (\u0027\u0027Sydney: the city that hates bikes\u0027\u0027, March 13-14)?\nMARCH 13\nLand grab push opens way for more dodgy deals\nWhat is the difference between a policymaking elected representative hired by voters and a developer (\u0027\u0027Private land to be seized for housing\u0027\u0027, March 12)? None, apparently. That is the impression one gets from the proposed Metropolitan Development Authority.\nMarch 12\nUp goes the finger and the partnership is broken\nHow do the letter writers who defended Michael Clarke\u0027s decision to return home to \u0027\u0027help support someone he loves\u0027\u0027 feel about him now it appears he returned purely to break up with her? PS: Warnie would have done it with a text message.\nMARCH 11\nPup deserves a pat for his loyal homing instinct\nWhenever there is a scandal involving sportsmen behaving badly, we rightly decry the negative attitudes towards women that pervade so much of male sport.\nMARCH 10\nNow some babies are worth more than others\nUnder Tony Abbott\u0027s parental leave scheme some people will be paid at a rate of $150,000 a year, and some will be paid at a rate of less than $30,000 a year (\u0027\u0027Abbott plan for a great big new tax\u0027\u0027, March 9). Given that the job description for both pay rates is \u0027\u0027caring for a baby\u0027\u0027, where is the wage justice?\nMARCH 9\nNo different laws for religious or ethnic groups\nThe call by Zachariah Matthews for sharia to be introduced shows that he misunderstands one of the fundamental principles on which this country is based, namely the rule of law (\u0027\u0027Muslim leader wants elements of sharia in Australia\u0027\u0027, March 8).\nNSW has failed so let Canberra have a go\nThe case for a complete takeover of health financing and delivery by the federal government is compelling from a grassroots perspective. The piecemeal approach of splitting primary healthcare and hospital and specialist services is ridiculous.\nMARCH 6\nWe need the surgery, but please use a steady hand\nThe federal government should be congratulated for proposing a new health policy to take us into the 21st century. It is obvious our health system is not coping and without radical changes it will become of third world quality in the foreseeable future.\nMARCH 5\nA shoddy renovation cannot fix a sick building\nWhen you build a house you start with the foundations. So it is with a health system. A renovated old house will soon develop cracks if the foundations are not strong enough to support the renovations. So it is with a health system.\nMarch 4\nMany lessons to be learnt in schools revolution\nContrary to Anne Rands\u0027s assertion (Letters, March 3), I am sure the various linguistic factions agree on what English grammar is, they just cannot agree on how it should be described, much less how it can be taught.\nMARCH 3\nIndecent haste puts primary teachers to the test\nJulia Gillard deliberately disregards the practical concerns of primary school teachers in her rush to have a national curriculum implemented next year.\nMarch 2\nIsrael is justified in defending itself from threats\nAmin Saikal is wrong to call the hit on Mahmoud al-Mabhouh terrorism (\u0027\u0027It is time for Israel\u0027s friends to condemn its acts of terrorism\u0027\u0027, March 1). This man was an armed combatant, whose chief aim was to destroy Israel and kill as many Israelis as possible. He was neither an innocent nor a civilian and it is the height of hypocrisy for Israel bashers to insist Israel does nothing while its enemies go out of their way to destroy it. If you fire rockets and missiles at someone with the intention of killing, you cannot complain if someone fires back.\nMarch 1\nLiving by the sword perpetuates cycle of hate\nThe notion that we are all children of God is not the essence of the Christian message as Stewart Mills says (Letters, February 27-28). We are all created by God, yes, but we all are alienated from God unless we have faith in Christ.\nFebruary 27\nIsrael alienates its friends, emboldens its enemies\nThe morality of extrajudicial killings is extraordinarily difficult, because they undermine the principle of the rule of law (\u0027\u0027\u0027Mossad\u0027 hit snares Australians\u0027\u0027, February 26). Who would not have wanted to get rid of Hitler?\nFebruary 26\nBarangaroo spawns a very Sydney argument\nFor decades Harry Seidler was vilified because he dared to design a residential tower on Blues Point. Elizabeth Farrelly attempts to justify something far more outrageous than anything Seidler might ever have contemplated (\u0027\u0027Keating: the new bandmaster leading our mini Manhattan\u0027\u0027, February 25). Is this the best architectural criticism the Herald can mount?\nFebruary 25\nKeating can\u0027t walk on water, so he\u0027ll build on it\nHow can the Barangaroo Delivery Authority and Paul Keating praise a plan to return two-thirds of Barangaroo to a more natural shoreline but in the next breath propose to fill in a long strip of the harbour to create an unnatural shoreline (\u0027\u0027Harbour high-rise breaks all the rules\u0027\u0027, February 24)? Isn\u0027t that re-creating the natural shoreline in one place and creating an unnatural one in another?\nFEBRUARY 24\nStreets are safer when violence is channelled\nThe fact that many of the Ultimate Fighting Championship fighters believe mixed martial arts helped them escape a life of delinquency means, to me at least, that the horror expressed by many of your readers (Letters, February 23) is unjustified and wrong.\nFEBRUARY 23\nSomething to rail against, again and again\nSo Kristina Keneally has released the 14th transport blueprint for the state in 15 years and expects the voters to re-elect her government two or possibly three times before it even starts work on the north-west rail link (\u0027\u0027All roads lead to the city\u0027\u0027, February 22). Not to mention giving no dates for the express trains from the Blue Mountains - the ones it axed a number of years ago.\nFEBRUARY 22\nCanberra must take on transport\nStuart Miller (Letters, February 19) is correct in identifying the wartime withdrawal of state taxing powers as the explanation of our long-term public transport funding problem. However, the solutions he offers - new state income taxation, or a root and branch review of Federation - seem unnecessarily complicated.\nFebruary 20\nRail network\u0027s star has faded - bring on the loops\nYesterday\u0027s letters were headed \u0027\u0027Transport planning just goes round in circles\u0027\u0027.

Matthew Johns. Photo: Steve Christo\nNot Lazarus, nor even \u0027\u0027Lazarus with a triple bypass\" could have dreamed of such a comeback, after such a demise.\nTHE MATTY JOHNS SHOW\nChannel Seven, last night\nNot Lazarus, nor even \u0027\u0027Lazarus with a triple bypass\" could have dreamed of such a comeback, after such a demise.\nEleven months ago, Matthew Johns exited the television screens of Australia a shattered man, his previously good name destroyed by a Four Corners exposÃ© of his involvement in a rugby league sex scandal in 2002. And yet, there he was last night, BAAAAACK!, fronting his own prime-time gig on Channel Seven, The Matty Johns Show.\nThe revolutionary premise of the new show appears to be that it is possible for a version of Channel Nine\u0027s Footy Show to succeed, by concentrating more on footy than anything.\nThis first version of the Johns show did not have a single fart joke, no leaguies dressed in women\u0027s clothing, no cheerleaders\u0027 cleavage and barely a wink and a nudge.\nInstead it relies on Johns acting as ringmaster for a relatively fast-paced presentation where he is the comedic talent.\nHave your say\nThere are lots of player profiles, Shane Webcke is the expert commentator doing the heavy lifting in serious rugby league analysis and Jason Stevens is the celebrity interviewer.\nDoes it work? Only sort of â€¦\nJohns\u0027s portrayal of Channel Nine gardener Don Burke as Don Kirk was not good enough to make us forget how wonderful his former Footy Show character Reg Reagan was. A skit on Sonny Bill Williams left me clueless as to what the joke was, but a league friend thought it hilarious.\nAs to the league talk, Webcke is not only the most eloquent of recent rugby league retirees but also the most outspoken - and quite likely only - critic of precisely the kind of activities that first brought Matthew Johns down.\nBut don\u0027t mention the war.\nWebcke certainly didn\u0027t last night, as league is remarkably free of current atrocities for him to dissect. As to Jason Stevens, he was rugby league\u0027s most famous - and quite likely only -celibate, until he got married last year, and did a fairly good job of interviewing the pop star Keisha.\nThe best part of the whole thing was the resuscitation of the hoary Controversy Corner where they actually asked Willie Mason some hard questions about where it all went wrong for him, and just what was the story about the rumours of his Roosters side throwing a game last year anyway?\nIn reply, a slightly shocked Mason bobbed and weaved, without divulging anything, but at least the questions were asked.\nAll up, the Matty Johns Show is off to a solid-ish, though not spectacular start.\nPersonally on watching it, I was reminded of how I felt after I first saw Super League. After all the hype and hoopla, it looked to me a lot like rugby league. This looked a lot like an upmarket version of the Footy Show.\nThe tempting thing, of course is for us in the media to build this up as a fight to the death between The Footy Show and The Matty Johns Show. But I suspect not. For I know I\u0027ll get no argument from Matty or Fatty when I say that with two such shows now promoting the code, \u0027\u0027rugby league was the winner on the day\".\nComments\n54 comments so far\nYour article is a bit like the show, insipid and pointless.\nFlo | Perth             - March 26, 2010, 9:03AM\nI am still angry a man like this is allowed to have a come back show, after his fall from grace he should stay off our screens. All is forgiven? Forgive not forget, he is still a disgusting man.\nStella - March 26, 2010, 9:01AM\nHe will never be forgiven in my eyes. Just a yobbo ...\nstevet - March 26, 2010, 8:53AM\nThis show was unbearable! He was fairly funny as Reg on TCN 9 (or whatever the characters name was), but this show was so bad - I suggest it won\u0027t last long.\nsnoopy | Stanmore             - March 26, 2010, 9:05AM\nI think its a bit much to say all is forgiven. As huge rugby league fan, I\u0027d rather Matty had nothing to do with the sport. Saying its better than the Footy Show is isn\u0027t say saying much either as the only real Footy Show is shown on Sundays.\nyani | Sydney             - March 26, 2010, 8:47AM\nI wish we could get this show here in NZ, the Footy Show has become pretty rubbish lately. As for Matty Johns being forgiven .. he behaved immorally and offended his wife and the woman involved, broke no laws, and got dumped by his employer and abandoned by his \"teammates\". His brother admitted being a user of illegal drugs for at least a substantial part of his playing career, is still on our screens every week, and is touted as a \"great\" of rugby league. Interesting.\nDollynz - March 26, 2010, 9:22AM\nIts disgusting that this goose is allowed to be on air, maybe they should of had Brett Stewart for Controversy Corner , vote with your remote and get this yobbo off the air..\nJan\u0027s not happy | Northern Beaches             - March 26, 2010, 9:23AM\nMaybe you and the media can forgive him, Peter. But not me. Nor most female footy fans I suspect. I can\u0027t see the point to him nor his pointless show. He should have stayed off air. He can go and coach a team or something but shouldn\u0027t be on TV. Just another boof head footy player.\ntd - March 26, 2010, 9:22AM\nI am truly shocked that [he] has been given a show on channel seven -- it shows that channel 7, and the advertisers who supported this program do not respect women in any way shape or form. All advertisers\u0027 products should be blacklisted. What is 7 going to do next? Give Dennis Ferguson his own show. Shame on you Channel Seven, your advertisers and anyone for watching...\nShocked | Sydney             - March 26, 2010, 9:22AM\nDidn\u0027t see the show but still think it\u0027s madness to allow representation at this level by a person who was dragged through the press and pilloried such a short time ago. Does not set a good example to those who have footy stars as aspirational role models. What statement does this prime time show make ? Forgive and forget ? Forgive maybe, but forget I don\u0027t think so. If it\u0027s about the code was Matty the only one capable of the job - is the talent pool that shallow or does channel 7 not look outside the obvious rating shannanigans ?\nnorfolknchance | Sydney             - March 26, 2010, 9:19AM\nShow more comments\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

But what Jarryd Hayne and Benji Marshall share is mutual admiration - and an admission from each that the other is almost impossible to stop.\nOn the eve of tonight\u0027s clash between Hayne\u0027s Parramatta and Marshall\u0027s Wests Tigers at Sydney Football Stadium, two of the most exciting players in the competition were asked how they viewed each other. But while both expressed admiration for their opponent\u0027s skills, neither had an idea how to shut the other out of the contest.\n\u0027\u0027The best thing about Benji is his second-phase play and the way he keeps the defensive line guessing all the time,\u0027\u0027 Hayne said yesterday.\n\u0027\u0027Obviously, our line defence and line speed will be important and we\u0027ll need to try to pressure him â€¦ but we can\u0027t let him play much because when he\u0027s in the zone he\u0027s hard to stop.\u0027\u0027\nAnd vice versa.\n\u0027\u0027Everyone knows how much of a freak he is, and how talented he is,\u0027\u0027 Marshall said of Hayne. \u0027\u0027He\u0027s just one of those players that people want to play with and are scared to play against.\n\u0027\u0027There\u0027s everything to fear when it comes to Jarryd. Just the stuff he can do with the ball â€¦ there\u0027s a lot of things you\u0027ve got to shut down, giving him less time with the ball and trying to shut him down earlier, but it\u0027s hard to shut a player down when they have so many good qualities, and Jarryd\u0027s just one of those guys where you\u0027ve got to be on the balls of your feet every time.\u0027\u0027\nThe two played with each other in the All Stars match earlier this year, giving Hayne a new respect for someone he had only ever played against.\n\u0027\u0027When you train with great players you can pick up on why they\u0027re so good,\u0027\u0027 the Eel said. \u0027\u0027It always seems that when you train with them they do a few tricks you haven\u0027t seen on TV.\u0027\u0027\nWhich, according to Marshall, all points to a \u0027\u0027match to remember\u0027\u0027 tonight. The last time they were on the field at NRL level, the pair produced brilliance - Marshall with a flick and Hayne with a chip - and the game was a classic. The Eels prevailed and surged to the grand final.\n\u0027\u0027We always seem to have good clashes against each other,\u0027\u0027 Marshall said. \u0027\u0027At last year\u0027s game, the atmosphere was unbelievable. It was quite a blur, it went so fast. I remember Jarryd\u0027s chip-and-chase pretty clearly because it won the game for them. It was a great spectacle.\n\u0027\u0027I think [tonight\u0027s] will be a game to remember. It could be one of those games that defines a season.\u0027\u0027\nIt is clearly a match that has many on edge. Tigers coach Tim Sheens, facing a one-from-three opening should his team succumb to the Eels, was eager to play up the pressure on Hayne but, equally, to play down his form. When asked yesterday whether Hayne was back to his best, he said: \u0027\u0027I wouldn\u0027t say that, but he had a very good second half of football [against Manly]. The hype around Jarryd is more pressure on Jarryd.\u0027\u0027\nThe referees are likely to feel the pinch as much as the players on such a stage. The Tigers have been concentrating on their discipline this week, having hardly tasted success with the two officials involved in tonight\u0027s clash.\nThe Tigers have won just 12 of 34 clashes under Tony Archer, and one match from six under Matt Cecchin. The Eels, comparatively, have a 50 per cent or higher record under both.\nJoin the conversation\n9 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 170 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 218 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 91 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 101 people read this\nCommon Business Main Index 266 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nCollis returns\nWhen Dean Collis plays his first game for Cronulla on Monday night, he ...\nCooper back on paddock for Dragons\nThere has been some calm before the storm of tonight\u0027s two clashes.

But while both expressed admiration for their opponent\u0027s skills, neither had an idea how to shut the other out of the contest.\n\u0027\u0027The best thing about Benji is his second-phase play and the way he keeps the defensive line guessing all the time,\u0027\u0027 Hayne said yesterday.\n\u0027\u0027Obviously, our line defence and line speed will be important and we\u0027ll need to try to pressure him â€¦ but we can\u0027t let him play much because when he\u0027s in the zone he\u0027s hard to stop.\u0027\u0027\nAnd vice versa.\n\u0027\u0027Everyone knows how much of a freak he is, and how talented he is,\u0027\u0027 Marshall said of Hayne. \u0027\u0027He\u0027s just one of those players that people want to play with and are scared to play against.\n\u0027\u0027There\u0027s everything to fear when it comes to Jarryd. Just the stuff he can do with the ball â€¦ there\u0027s a lot of things you\u0027ve got to shut down, giving him less time with the ball and trying to shut him down earlier, but it\u0027s hard to shut a player down when they have so many good qualities, and Jarryd\u0027s just one of those guys where you\u0027ve got to be on the balls of your feet every time.\u0027\u0027\nThe two played with each other in the All Stars match earlier this year, giving Hayne a new respect for someone he had only ever played against.\n\u0027\u0027When you train with great players you can pick up on why they\u0027re so good,\u0027\u0027 the Eel said. \u0027\u0027It always seems that when you train with them they do a few tricks you haven\u0027t seen on TV.\u0027\u0027\nWhich, according to Marshall, all points to a \u0027\u0027match to remember\u0027\u0027 tonight. The last time they were on the field at NRL level, the pair produced brilliance - Marshall with a flick and Hayne with a chip - and the game was a classic. The Eels prevailed and surged to the grand final.\n\u0027\u0027We always seem to have good clashes against each other,\u0027\u0027 Marshall said. \u0027\u0027At last year\u0027s game, the atmosphere was unbelievable. It was quite a blur, it went so fast. I remember Jarryd\u0027s chip-and-chase pretty clearly because it won the game for them. It was a great spectacle.\n\u0027\u0027I think [tonight\u0027s] will be a game to remember. It could be one of those games that defines a season.\u0027\u0027\nIt is clearly a match that has many on edge. Tigers coach Tim Sheens, facing a one-from-three opening should his team succumb to the Eels, was eager to play up the pressure on Hayne but, equally, to play down his form. When asked yesterday whether Hayne was back to his best, he said: \u0027\u0027I wouldn\u0027t say that, but he had a very good second half of football [against Manly]. The hype around Jarryd is more pressure on Jarryd.\u0027\u0027\nThe referees are likely to feel the pinch as much as the players on such a stage. The Tigers have been concentrating on their discipline this week, having hardly tasted success with the two officials involved in tonight\u0027s clash.\nThe Tigers have won just 12 of 34 clashes under Tony Archer, and one match from six under Matt Cecchin. The Eels, comparatively, have a 50 per cent or higher record under both.\nJoin the conversation\n10 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 204 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 222 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 130 people read this\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ... 103 people read this\nCommon Business Main Index 316 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes head to head with Fatty\nNot Lazarus, nor even \u0027\u0027Lazarus with a triple bypass\" could have ...\nCollis returns\nWhen Dean Collis plays his first game for Cronulla on Monday night, he ...\nCooper back on paddock for Dragons\nThere has been some calm before the storm of tonight\u0027s two clashes.

Brett Morris takes a bomb at Dragons training. Photo: Dave Tease\nSt George Illawarra coach Wayne Bennett has spoken publicly for the first time about his interest in signing Willie Mason and predicted the former Test forward will make an impact at the Cowboys this season once he settles into his new club.\nBennett made the comments on the eve of tonight\u0027s clash with North Queensland in Wollongong and said he expected the change of clubs to benefit Mason after he spent virtually the entire off-season exiled from Sydney Roosters until finally reaching a deal with the Cowboys.\nBefore Mason\u0027s future was resolved, the Dragons were among a handful of clubs to show an interest in signing him but salary cap pressure made it too difficult and in the end North Queensland and Newcastle were his only genuine options after News Ltd representatives stepped in to stop a two-year deal with Melbourne that was revealed by the Herald.\n\u0027\u0027I\u0027m always interested in good players,\u0027\u0027 Bennett said after training yesterday. \u0027\u0027I\u0027d coached him in two Australian teams in 2004 and 2005 and I enjoyed working with him. I didn\u0027t have a problem with him.\n\u0027\u0027I rate Willie. It just hasn\u0027t come together overnight but they\u0027re obviously confident that he can do something for them. They wanted him there, they put him in the team and he\u0027ll get better each week. He\u0027s going to a new club and lots of times that happens when you\u0027re at a new club and a new environment.\u0027\u0027\nAsked if he thought Mason would be motivated this season by wanting to prove a point after effectively being shown the door by the Roosters, Bennett said: \u0027\u0027I\u0027m not sure about all those things with Willie, I\u0027m just telling you how I feel about him.\u0027\u0027\nAfter being forced by the Roosters to train on his own during the off-season before signing with the Cowboys six weeks ago, Mason has played off the bench in the opening two premiership matches and North Queensland coach Neil Henry believes he is best suited to that role at the moment.\n\u0027\u0027He had a very disjointed year last year and things didn\u0027t go right at the Roosters. It was a difficult year to be motivated,\u0027\u0027 Henry said. \u0027\u0027That confidence you get from winning, you can lose that pretty quick.\n\u0027\u0027But he\u0027s been great for us. He\u0027s passionate about his footy, he\u0027s a talker and we\u0027re quite a quiet team, so he lifts our forwards a bit.\u0027\u0027\nIn his 44-minute stint against Penrith, Mason made 18 tackles, 11 hit-ups and three off-loads but former NSW and Australian teammate Luke O\u0027Donnell, who was one of the senior players that pushed for Cowboys management to sign him said his contribution to the team was far greater than his on-field performance.\n\u0027\u0027He\u0027s been a positive influence on the other blokes, on and off the field,\u0027\u0027 O\u0027Donnell said. \u0027\u0027I\u0027d never played club footy with him but this is the keenest I have seen him. He\u0027s really come up and made a seamless move into the way we do things and our training, which is pretty solid. He came up in good shape and with a good attitude and he\u0027s fitted in well with all the boys.\n\u0027\u0027I think he\u0027s been good for us off the bench and he is only going to get better. He is looking like he is well and truly back from his knee injury and I think he probably left the Roosters not the way he would have liked, so he\u0027s looking to have a big year with us.

The location was ANZ Stadium, the original clapped-out former Commonwealth Games ground in Brisbane, not the Homebush Bay version, and the result was a resounding 42-8 win for Tuqiri\u0027s Broncos over Tahu\u0027s Newcastle.\nTuqiri would score 21 tries from 29 matches that season and earn Queensland and Australia honours. Tahu, a year his junior, took another 12 months to play for state and country but recorded 18 tries in 24 games, including one in the Knights\u0027 grand final win over Parramatta.\nThe statistics back up the memories: Even at only 21 and 20 they were already two of the game\u0027s try-scoring forces. Nine years later Tuqiri and Tahu are league \u0027\u0027newcomers\u0027\u0027 again, having danced over to rugby union before eventually returning.\nTeammates in their 15-a-side lives at West Harbour, NSW and Australia there is a mutual respect between the pair born of a shared experience. \"I know he wants to play rep footy again in rugby league and I can\u0027t see anything stopping him achieving those goals,\u0027\u0027 Tahu said of Tuqiri. \u0027\u0027He\u0027s still one of the best wingers in the world in either code.\n\"I have a lot of respect for Lote after playing with him for the Waratahs and Australia; he\u0027s an amazing athlete but he\u0027s also a real leader now too who helped me a lot when I switched to rugby.\u0027\u0027\nTahu holds Tuqiri up as the benchmark for league converts to union. It is not an outlandish statement: the dreadlocked winger\u0027s 67 Tests for the Wallabies comfortably eclipsed modern-day converts Mat Rogers, Wendell Sailor and Tahu himself. The Eels centre, who has his own aspirations to return to the league heights he once graced, believes Tuqiri\u0027s switch back will continue to roll on smoothly.\n\"He handled the transition to rugby probably better than any of us and he\u0027ll switch back just as impressively â€¦ ,\u0027\u0027 he said. \u0027\u0027He loves the physical confrontational stuff and to get in their faces. He\u0027s already shown he\u0027s still got the aggression.\"\nHe has also shown he is not to be underestimated. Tahu says Manly - Wests Tigers\u0027 first-round opponents a fortnight ago - erred by thinking they could expose Tuqiri out wide in his first NRL game for eight years. Parramatta, Tahu says, will not be making the same mistake at the Sydney Football Stadium tonight.\n\"Lote is the type of player who doesn\u0027t like anyone to get over the top of him; he\u0027s so competitive and consistent,\u0027\u0027 Tahu said.\n\"Manly talking up how they were going to target Lote in round one would have only made him play better. For us, he\u0027s a danger, not a target.\u0027\u0027\nJoin the conversation\n5 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 213 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 89 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 153 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 76 people read this\nLeague HQ 28 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nTiger Tuqiri can see a clear, green future ahead of him\nThe Wests Tigers winger won\u0027t be looking over his shoulder this year, ...\nBennett admits he\u0027s keen on Mason\nSt George Illawarra coach Wayne Bennett has spoken publicly for the ...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes head to head with Fatty\nNot Lazarus, nor even \u0027\u0027Lazarus with a triple bypass\" could have ...\nCollis returns\nWhen Dean Collis plays his first game for Cronulla on Monday night, he ...\nCooper back on paddock for Dragons\nThere has been some calm before the storm of tonight\u0027s two clashes.

But after undergoing surgery yesterday he was told by doctors he would miss the whole season.\n\u0027\u0027It is a terrible blow to any club to lose a strike player like that,\u0027\u0027 Manly chief executive Graham Lowe said. \u0027\u0027We were hoping he\u0027d be back for round 20 but that is out of the question now. The team all shares a sense of disappointment but in saying that we\u0027ve just got to move on.\u0027\u0027\nStewart suffered the injury to his left knee making a try-saving tackle on Wests Tigers winger Lote Tuqiri 12 days ago.\n\u0027\u0027It was a shock to Brett and to the entire club but he is a fighter and he will be back as good as ever,\u0027\u0027 said Manly coach Hasler.\n\u0027\u0027The operation went well and Brett will make a full recovery but it won\u0027t be this season that\u0027s certain and we now have to get on with the rest of the season without him.\u0027\u0027\nAs they come to grips with life without Stewart, Lowe said the club had also swiftly put to bed the frustrations over the 24-20 loss to the Eels that even days later was so tough to swallow. Remonstrations about the forward pass, then revelations about Hasler\u0027s accidental He-Man antics in the away sheds afterwards have given the controversial encounter an extended shelf life.\nBut Lowe insisted the winless Sea Eagles had shut the drama of last Sunday out of their minds before tomorrow night\u0027s stoush with Newcastle in Gosford.\n\u0027\u0027You have two options when that stuff happens,\u0027\u0027 Lowe said. \u0027\u0027You can either waste energy thinking about it or going over post-mortems or get ready for the next game. That\u0027s what Dessie and the guys have done. They\u0027re getting on with it.\u0027\u0027\nMeanwhile, Cronulla have announced second-rower Reece Williams remains intent on resuming his career despite having a blood clot found on his spine. The 24-year-old, who was admitted to hospital on Sunday after being knocked out in a NSW Cup match at Shellharbour, underwent surgery at St Vincent\u0027s Hospital on Wednesday night which was deemed successful.\nSharks coach Ricky Stuart visited Williams in hospital yesterday. \"Everyone in rugby league wishes him a speedy recovery,\u0027\u0027 Stuart said. \u0027\u0027Regaining his health is his number one priority and the Sharks will support him all the way.\"\nRugby league is mourning the loss of one of the game\u0027s pioneering administrators, NSWRL vice-president Charlie Gibson, who passed away yesterday morning aged 78 after a short battle with cancer. The first full-time secretary of South Sydney, Gibson played 31 first-grade games as a forward for the Rabbitohs before guiding the club through one of its greatest eras - 1967-71.\nwith AAP\nJoin the conversation\n3 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nSport 27 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 205 people read this\nBennett admits he\u0027s keen on Mason 13 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 148 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 131 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nBennett admits he\u0027s keen on Mason\nSt George Illawarra coach Wayne Bennett has spoken publicly for the ...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes head to head with Fatty\nNot Lazarus, nor even \u0027\u0027Lazarus with a triple bypass\" could have ...\nCollis returns\nWhen Dean Collis plays his first game for Cronulla on Monday night, he ...\nCooper back on paddock for Dragons\nThere has been some calm before the storm of tonight\u0027s two clashes.

The location was ANZ Stadium, the original clapped-out former Commonwealth Games ground in Brisbane, not the Homebush Bay version, and the result was a resounding 42-8 win for Tuqiri\u0027s Broncos over Tahu\u0027s Newcastle.\nNathan\u0027s long wait for another shot at Jason over\nNathan Cayless can\u0027t win.

But in a scintillating burst of scoring, Parramatta fullback Jarryd Hayne willed and skilled his team home, 24-20.\nOne cut-out pass from left to right landed on the chest of his winger, sending him on an unmarked journey to the try line, leaving Manly players staring at each in stunned disbelief.\nOK, another try-scoring left-to-right pass from another Parramatta player was so forward it caused me some brief empathy with the shocked Silvertails â€¦ but the feeling quickly evaporated.\nHayne can elude a tackler in a phone booth. He wrong-foots defenders, plunging them in some unseen white water that leaves them at war with their own momentum, groping desperately upstream. He is the bus passenger who does not like the look of his stop and keeps going.\nHayne astonished me. I have not seen anyone do so many exciting things with the ball in so many different ways in so short a time.\nThe last time I sat alone watching a game so far away, yet became so energised and excited, was the early morning live TV coverage of the deciding Test in England in 1978 when Les Boyd won the game in the first half. Boyd was Babe Ruth pointing to the stands in the 1932 baseball World Series, signalling his imminent home run. Like Hayne, Boyd played above everybody that day and Kangaroos coach, Frank Stanton, was so moved, he walked to the sidelines at half-time and escorted the second-rower from the field.\nHayne\u0027s play captivated Victorians, judging by comment on the radio the following morning and the remarks made a couple of days later at a wake for Geoff McClure, The Age\u0027s long-time columnist. OK, more Melburnians saw the NRL game than normal, it being the last Sunday before the AFL season began last night, but Hayne\u0027s efforts will help fill the Storm\u0027s new 30,000-seat AAMI Park.\nStorm coach Craig Bellamy, on the way to Melbourne from Newcastle, missed the match, although some saw the first half via pay TV on their flight. \u0027\u0027We heard 20-nil, then when we got home it was 24-20,\u0027\u0027 he said, a similar turnaround to his own team surrendering 14 points to the Knights, then scoring the next 20. \u0027\u0027I can\u0027t ever remember a round of football like last weekend when there were so many comebacks.\u0027\u0027\nCoaches are fixated on the present and the future. I reminded Bellamy the same phenomenon occurred the previous weekend when five of the eight games recorded massive swings. Possession and field position have always been the keys to scoring but rugby league is graduating more skilful young attackers like Wests Tigers five-eighth Benji Marshall and Hayne - whose teams meet tonight - players capable of sparking tries from their own half.\nFurthermore, referees rarely punish the attack. Last weekend, I saw countless play-the-balls where the attacking player did not touch the ball with his foot. Twenty years ago, these misdemeanours lost semi-finals.\nWhen referees only blow the whistle against the defence, the attacking team enjoys consecutive sets of possession and, in the heat of March, tries are inevitable. However, penalties cannot be blamed for all the swings over the past two weekends.\nBellamy, also the NSW coach, offers a clue, with his observation of Hayne, who did not play at his best last year until the first State of Origin match in Melbourne. \u0027\u0027I don\u0027t know how fit he is,\u0027\u0027 Bellamy said. \u0027\u0027You can\u0027t do brilliant things all game, no matter how good you are, if you are not fit. I don\u0027t know how often he puts himself in a position to do those things. Obviously as the season goes on, he gets fitter and can do those brilliant things more often.\u0027\u0027\nOver the past few seasons, there has been a change in the mindset of some NRL coaches, where they adopt an easier approach to the pre-season, in order to offset exhaustion at the end. But this leads to teams being under-done early in the year. Hayne\u0027s opponents, Manly, have lost their first two games and surrendered big leads on both occasions.\nBellamy\u0027s opponents, Newcastle, were fortunate to survive a Bulldogs comeback in round one and surrendered to the Storm in the second half at home. Penrith were fortunate to survive a comeback from the Raiders in round one and then were overtaken by the Cowboys last weekend, making their contest with the fit Storm side tomorrow a test of the theory.\nHayne joined his fingers and thumbs in the shape of a diamond at the end of his game to symbolise a sparkling effort, in comparison to those moments when he does not shine as bright. But his scoring bursts are also symbolic of a code where points swings have become standard and the reason is maybe the oldest in the book: fitness, or the lack thereof.\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNRL Fixtures 25 people read this\nLeague HQ 28 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 202 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 101 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 212 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nBennett admits he\u0027s keen on Mason\nSt George Illawarra coach Wayne Bennett has spoken publicly for the ...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes head to head with Fatty\nNot Lazarus, nor even \u0027\u0027Lazarus with a triple bypass\" could have ...\nCollis returns\nWhen Dean Collis plays his first game for Cronulla on Monday night, he ...\nCooper back on paddock for Dragons\nThere has been some calm before the storm of tonight\u0027s two clashes.

Reddy\u0027s formal signature nonetheless comes as a welcome relief after the departure of foundation goalkeeper Clint Bolton, who has signed with Melbourne Heart.\nReddy caught the eye with a number of scintillating performances for Wellington Phoenix towards the end of the season, a club he temporarily joined after an acrimonious departure from Brisbane Roar.\nHowever, he expects his stay in Sydney to be a permanent one, with trophies - as much as a homecoming - the major reason behind his decision to sign with the Sky Blues.\n\u0027\u0027This club isn\u0027t happy to settle for top-six finishes or anything like that, they want to win things every year,\u0027\u0027 Reddy said yesterday. \u0027\u0027They\u0027ve got a great coaching staff and structure at the club and that was a major drawcard for me. This club wants to achieve things and I want to win a major competition so that was the major reason I\u0027ve come here.\n\u0027\u0027But [it\u0027s] also about returning home. I\u0027m a Sydney boy and I\u0027ve been away for five years now so it\u0027s fantastic for me to come home and play in front of family and friends.\u0027\u0027\nStepping into the boots of Bolton - which grew significantly following his outstanding final season with the club - presents a big challenge for Reddy, but he is comfortable about leaving his own mark.\n\u0027\u0027Clint\u0027s been a fantastic player for the club for the past five years,\u0027\u0027 Reddy said. \u0027\u0027But I\u0027m my own person and I hope to achieve what Clint\u0027s achieved this past year - winning the double and having a fantastic year.\u0027\u0027\nPushing Reddy for his place between the sticks will be luckless deputy Ivan Necevski, who failed to play a single minute of the championship season as Bolton held sway. However, Reddy knows he will have to fight to keep his spot against a \u0027\u0027very good keeper\u0027\u0027.\nReddy is the first official new signing of the off-season for the Sky Blues, though there will be plenty of action on the transfer front given Bolton, Simon Colosimo, Karol Kisel and Mitchell Prentice have all left the club, while captain Steve Corica has retired. Marquee player John Aloisi is likely to join the exodus with an announcement on his future understood to be not far away.\nSydney FC goalkeeping coach John Filan believes Reddy has all the attributes to succeed, saying his brilliant stint with Wellington - which Reddy undertook after agreeing to future terms with Sydney - was a great sign.\n\u0027\u0027I think the important thing from there was how well he affected the whole side,\u0027\u0027 Filan said. \u0027\u0027He was a major factor when he came in as to how well they went at the end of the season. If you spoke to the playing staff, I think they\u0027d more than back up that statement. We were very impressed with that.\u0027\u0027\nThe 28-year-old might be returning to Sydney with a decade of senior experience under his belt, but coach Vitezslav Lavicka was keen to sign him because he is confident Reddy still has his best years ahead of him.\n\u0027\u0027It is our main goal [to reduce the squad age],\u0027\u0027 Lavicka said. \u0027\u0027Bolton did a great job for Sydney FC but now we make the decision and I trust that Liam Reddy will be the right person.\u0027\u0027\nJoin the conversation\n8 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 248 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 224 people read this\nCommon Business Main Index 242 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 91 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 171 people read this\nTop Sport articles\nFears champion\u0027s big heart gave out\nWebber\u0027s make-or-break year, says Hamilton\nMancini and Moyes face FA probe after touchline row\nWarne\u0027s Royals upset Punjab\nReddy ready to assume No.1 role with Sydney\nMore Sport articles\nFootball Topics\nTeamsExpand (1256)\nAll Teams (1256)\nSocceroos (428)\nManchester United (375)\nChelsea (331)\nLiverpool (295)\nArsenal (265)\nEverton (204)\nManchester City (185)\nMilan (177)\nTottenham (154)\nBarcelona (153)\nFulham (152)\nAston Villa (151)\nReal Madrid (129)\nPortsmouth (126)\nBlackburn (126)\nSunderland (119)\nBolton (109)\nWigan (97)\nInter (95)\nSydney FC (90)\nBirmingham (81)\nBurnley (80)\nMelbourne Victory (58)\nValencia (56)\nBayern Munich (51)\nNewcastle Jets (50)\nJuventus (48)\nPerth Glory (46)\nGold Coast United (40)\nBrisbane Roar (39)\nFiorentina (37)\nVillarreal (36)\nAdelaide United (34)\nAtletico Madrid (31)\nMore Teams\nPeopleExpand (1187)\nAll People (1187)\nPim Verbeek (206)\nAlex Ferguson (150)\nTim Cahill (131)\nRonaldo (127)\nCristiano Ronaldo (107)\nWayne Rooney (101)\nLucas Neill (99)\nMark Schwarzer (94)\nGuus Hiddink (92)\nSteven Gerrard (84)\nDidier Drogba (76)\nFernando Torres (70)\nArsene Wenger (65)\nCarlos Tevez (64)\nDavid Beckham (62)\nJohn Terry (61)\nFrank Lampard (61)\nJason Culina (50)\nBen Buckley (49)\nCesc Fabregas (48)\nMichael Owen (47)\nCraig Moore (47)\nDirk Kuyt (46)\nNicolas Anelka (44)\nDavid Moyes (43)\nMile Sterjovski (41)\nRio Ferdinand (40)\nRyan Giggs (40)\nDimitar Berbatov (39)\nMark Viduka (38)\nKaka (37)\nAshley Cole (35)\nMark Hughes (35)\nEmmanuel Adebayor (35)\nPetr Cech (34)\nMichael Ballack (33)\nHarry Redknapp (33)\nMichael Carrick (32)\nChris Coyne (32)\nRobinho (32)\nPeter Crouch (31)\nFlorent Malouda (31)\nArchie Thompson (31)\nDarren Bent (31)\nSepp Blatter (31)\nJohn Aloisi (30)\nMore People\nCompetitionsExpand (1063)\nAll Competitions (1063)\nWorld Cup (613)\nChampions League (349)\nA-League (199)\nEnglish Premier League (126)\nAsian Cup (112)\nSerie A (51)\nAsian Champions League (49)\nConfederations Cup (46)\nUEFA Cup (43)\nBundesliga (31)\nMore Competitions\nIssuesExpand (402)\nAll Issues (402)\nFIFA (189)\nFFA (117)\nInjuries (76)\nPenalties (31)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nPopular Phones \u0026 Plans\nPhones\nDeals\nBrands\n1) Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB\n36 plans\nÂ 8%\n2) Apple iPhone 3GS 32GB\n36 plans\nÂ 2%\n3) Apple iPhone 8GB\n43 plans\nÂ 3%\n4) Nokia N97\n40 plans\nÂ 1%\n5) HTC Magic\n5 plans\nÂ 2%\nThis Guy is Not\nBob.

Stuart Gibson.\nSince he was a teenager growing up in grey, rainy Glasgow, Stuart Gibson had a dream â€“ to run across the Sahara Desert.\nNext week, he heads to Morocco in North Africa to fulfil it - by taking part in the 25th Marathon Des Sables, a gruelling 243-kilometre endurance run held over six days.\nâ€œI remember watching this race on television with my dad many years ago â€¦ and I thought to myself one day, I would like to do that,â€ he says.\nThe 33-year-old Australian is no stranger to ultra-running, the next step up from long-distance running.\nHe\u0027s competed in half-marathons and marathons across Europe and Australia, represented Great Britain at the European Championships in Lisbon, and hopes to one day represent Australia at the ultra-distance world championships.\nBut he\u0027ll face extreme conditions in the Sahara.\nThe desert is the largest in the world and also one of the hottest. Gibson will be running in what is considered to be the world\u0027s hardest foot race, with temperatures that range from 50 degrees Celsius in the day to 3 degrees Celsius at night as sandstorms blow past.\nThrow in the fact that he\u0027ll have to be entirely self-sufficient and carry his own food and sleeping bag while his water supply is rationed, and it\u0027s no surprise the construction engineer\u0027s been training hard for the competition.\nâ€œI\u0027ve been running about 180 kilometres a week â€“ that\u0027s 90 minutes of running plus a four to five-hour run Saturday, Sunday.\nâ€œAnd I\u0027ll be running with a backpack or rucksack and that will sometimes be eight or nine kilos. So it\u0027s been a general build-up over the past six months.\nâ€œIt\u0027s a lot of time spent running and most of that is actually spent running off-road, so in parks, fire trails, and some of it is on sand.â€\nAll this training takes place while Gibson works as an engineer for AE Smith, a mechanical services contractor.\nHe admits he spends more time with his running shoes than with his wife, and that he has little time for a social life.\nBut for him, running is â€œmy funâ€ and he says both his wife and his employer are very understanding of his training regime.\nâ€œMy wife is Scottish and she\u0027s the total opposite of me,\" Gibson says.\nâ€œShe hasn\u0027t seen much of me recently but she\u0027s been very supportive. She\u0027s always known I\u0027ve been a keen runner.\nâ€œâ€¦ if I wanted any extra time off work it would be very easy. [AE Smith] are very supportive and try to push a good work-life balance amongst their staff.â€\nGibson has also found time to raise money for the Ronald McDonald House, a charity helping seriously ill children and their families that\u0027s also supported by AE Smith. He\u0027s raised $900 so far and hopes to raise another $600 more before he flies off to Morocco next Tuesday.\nOnce there, he\u0027ll join 1100 other participants, some serious ultra-marathoners, others hoping to raise money for charities, in what he believes will be a life-changing experience.\nâ€œAssuming I have a good race, I hope to be in the top 50. The most important thing is to stay hydrated and avoid foot blisters, which is basically sand getting into your shoes. It\u0027s what contributes to most of the competitor drop-outs.\nâ€œ[But] â€¦ what you can\u0027t lose sight of is that you\u0027re running in the Sahara Desert, one of the most spectacular places in the world, so I really hope to take in some of that landscape and remember it.\nâ€œAnd obviously take some nice photographs while I\u0027m there.â€\nThe Marathon Des Sables starts on Sunday, April 4 and finishes on Saturday, April 10.

She said last night that his inappropriate behaviour was \u0027\u0027an open secret\u0027\u0027 in the industry.\nSerious allegations...the cast of the sitcom Hey Dad!, including Robert Hughes, wearing a tie, and Sarah Monaghan, right.\nThe sisters were family friends of Hughes.\n\u0027\u0027It was really quite evil and sinister,\u0027\u0027 one said. \u0027\u0027It was always quite short and quick, and hands everywhere.

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

Photo: Getty Images\nSandra Bullock\u0027s husband allegedly cheated on her with another two women.\nJesse James â€“ whose alleged 11-month affair with tattoo model Michelle \u0027Bombshell\u0027 McGee was revealed last week â€“ has now been accused of having affairs with stripper Melissa Smith and photographer Brigitte Daguerre after he married the Oscar-winning actress in 2005, according to gossip website TMZ.\nThe motorcycle enthusiast allegedly met Smith on social networking site MySpace in 2006 and the pair had a two-year secret romance.\nIt is claimed James then embarked on a fling with Daguerre in 2008 after meeting her the year before when he hired her for a photo shoot for his West Coast Chopper business.\nDaguerre alleges the pair exchanged texts and emails for a year, but insists they only had sex four times in that period.\nMany of the messages were very explicit and he asked her to send racy pictures of herself.\nOn Wednesday, it was reported that James was accused of sexual harassment by one of his former female executives at his West Coast Choppers business in 2007.\nThe unnamed woman claimed James repeatedly made sexual advances and she kept several suggestive emails from him, as well as a stained T-shirt.\nAlthough no lawsuit was ever filed, the matter was settled for $US725,000 in September 2007.\nJames neither admitted nor denied the allegations.\nLast week, James apologised for having a relationship with McGee and admitted he deserves \"everything bad\" which may come from his \"bad judgment\".\nThrough his publicist Monique Huey-Jones, James said: \"The vast majority of the allegations reported are untrue and unfounded. Beyond that, I will not dignify these private matters with any further public comment. There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me. It\u0027s because of my poor judgment that I deserve everything bad that is coming my way.\"\nBANG!

Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care.

Monica Bellucci with husband Vincent Cassel.\nMonica Bellucci is like an \"ordinary farm wife\".\nThe 45-year-old actress - who is six months pregnant with her second child - has posed naked to show off her baby bump for Italy\u0027s Vanity Fair magazine for the second time, but insists she is just a normal mother-to-be who feels \"lucky\" to be expecting another baby.\nShe said: \"Women who have children late like me are always told how brave they are and it\u0027s true that the older you are the more risks you run both for the child and yourself. But I don\u0027t feel brave I just feel very lucky. I already have a healthy daughter who I gave birth to in Umbria like an ordinary farm wife. This second pregnancy is just as fantastic but I wouldn\u0027t say I was an example to follow.\"\nWhile she understands having children later in life isn\u0027t ideal, the actress - who already has five-year-old daughter Deva with her husband Vincent Cassel - couldn\u0027t make up her mind about whether or not she wanted to have a second child.\nShe explained: \"When I had my first child at 39 I was told that if I wanted another I should try straight away but I wasn\u0027t ready. \"Eventually I decided that I was and I wanted one straight away but babies are not like movies and cannot be organised in a hurry.\"\nMonica - who also posed nude when she was pregnant with Deva - never felt in any rush to start a family, but admits she is \"lucky\" to have fallen pregnant without too many problems.\nShe explained: \"My paternal grandmother had a child at 47 years old but I think I\u0027m just lucky. I know women who would cross the desert on their knees to have a child. Maybe if that had happened to me and I had difficulty then I would have become one of them.\"\nBang Showbiz\nComments\nBe the first to comment.\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you.

Jesse James and Sandra Bullock. Photo: Getty Images\nSandra Bullock has told friends there is no chance of saving her marriage.\nThe US actress - who recently won an Oscar for her performance in The Blind Side - told friends that since her husband of five years, Jesse James, cheated on her with tattoo model Michelle \"Bombshell\" McGee, she can\u0027t trust him enough to give him another chance.\nA friend of the actress told the Chicago Sun Times newspaper: \"Sandy has decided there\u0027s no way their relationship can be fixed. Once the trust is gone, there\u0027s nothing left.\"\nBullock is also said to be distraught at being apart from James\u0027s six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, Sunny. Another source claims the actress might seek custody of the girl if a divorce goes ahead.\nThe source told X17 Online: \"Sandra is going to go ahead and file for divorce and she is also wanting to get custody of Mr James\u0027s young daughter.\n\"Her lawyers are telling her that there is a possibility that she could get custody since the child\u0027s mother is unfit and Jesse is an adulterer. She wants that little girl and is ready to fight to get her.\"\nSunny has lived with James and Bullock since her biological mother, adult film star Janine Lindemulder, was jailed for tax evasion in December 2008. Lindemulder has since battled to regain custody of Sunny.\nJames also has two other children from a previous marriage.\nBullock, 45, left her the home she shared with James over a week ago and friends have told she is \"devastated\" by her husband\u0027s behaviour.\nJames has spoken publicly about the allegations and admits he deserves \"everything bad\" that might come from his \"bad judgment\".\nHe said: \"There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me. It\u0027s because of my poor judgment that I deserve everything bad that is coming my way.\"\n\"Chronic cheater\"\nJames has been branded a â€œchronic cheaterâ€ by Lindemulder\nLindemulder â€“ who separated from the motorcycle enthusiast after one year of marriage in May 2003 â€“ insists she was not surprised to learn the Monster Garage presenter had bedded McGee.\nShe said: \"He\u0027s a chronic cheater. I feel sorry for Sandra because she was so in love with Jesse that she was blind and gullible. She once said, \u0027I finally have a man who has my back.\u0027 And all I could think was, \u0027No. You have this man who does it behind your back.\u0027\"\nLindemulder claims that James was unfaithful to her soon after they tied the knot and he refused to change his behaviour throughout their union.\nShe also claims he propositioned her over the phone when he was with Bullock.\nShe said: â€œI remember at one point, about six months after he started dating Sandra, when he asked me to come by the shop. I told him, \u0027No way.\u0027 Later, he texted me, \u0027Thank God you didn\u0027t come by, because we would have been bad.\u0027\n\"His famous line was, \u0027Tell me something nice.\u0027 He would say he\u0027d had a rough day and wanted you to tell him something nice â€¦ It was hard to say no to the guy.\"\nThe former porn star also alleges James told her he regretted marrying Bullock just weeks after they tied the knot in July 2005.\nSpeaking of a phone call she received from James shortly after the wedding, Lindemulder  told In Touch Weekly magazine: \"He said, \u0027I want to come up to Oregon. I think I made a huge mistake.\u0027\"\nBANG Showbiz\nJoin the conversation\n20 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 225 people read this\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two ... 84 people read this\nSMH Mobile 39 people read this\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey ... 5 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 198 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nSandra Bullock\u0027s husband hounded by women\n22 Mar\nSandra Bullock\u0027s husband Jesse James \"heavily targeted\" by women.\nClick to play video\nVideo\nBullock looks for divorce lawyer\nTop Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nMore Life \u0026 Style articles\nPeople Topics\nCelebritiesExpand (660)\nAll Celebrities (660)\nMichael Jackson (196)\nParis Hilton (81)\nVictoria Beckham (59)\nOprah Winfrey (44)\nDavid Beckham (43)\nPrince William (40)\nKate Moss (35)\nMiranda Kerr (29)\nJessica Simpson (25)\nNicole Richie (20)\nCarla Bruni (16)\nPrince Harry (13)\nEllen Degeneres (12)\nNaomi Campbell (10)\nGisele Bundchen (10)\nHeidi Klum (7)\nTyra Banks (3)\nMaria Sharapova (2)\nMore Celebrities\nActressesExpand (557)\nAll Actresses (557)\nAngelina Jolie (114)\nJennifer Aniston (85)\nNicole Kidman (83)\nKatie Holmes (66)\nDemi Moore (39)\nCate Blanchett (32)\nScarlett Johansson (26)\nGwyneth Paltrow (25)\nSarah Jessica Parker (24)\nSienna Miller (24)\nJennifer Lopez (23)\nReese Witherspoon (23)\nMischa Barton (22)\nKate Winslet (20)\nHalle Berry (19)\nKate Hudson (19)\nCameron Diaz (18)\nNaomi Watts (16)\nUma Thurman (14)\nKeira Knightley (13)\nAnne Hathaway (12)\nDrew Barrymore (11)\nCourteney Cox (11)\nEva Mendes (10)\nJennifer Love Hewitt (8)\nCatherine Zeta-jones (7)\nJessica Biel (7)\nSalma Hayek (6)\nNatalie Portman (6)\nMeg Ryan (6)\nKirsten Dunst (5)\nElizabeth Hurley (4)\nEva Longoria Parker (4)\nChristina Applegate (4)\nTeri Hatcher (3)\nAlicia Silverstone (2)\nMandy Moore (2)\nMore Actresses\nActorsExpand (450)\nAll Actors (450)\nBrad Pitt (112)\nTom Cruise (102)\nGeorge Clooney (32)\nJohn Travolta (29)\nHugh Jackman (27)\nRussell Crowe (25)\nJohnny Depp (24)\nOrlando Bloom (21)\nWill Smith (19)\nJude Law (18)\nHugh Grant (11)\nAlec Baldwin (10)\nMatthew Mcconaughey (10)\nMatt Damon (10)\nBen Affleck (10)\nMatthew Broderick (9)\nJim Carrey (8)\nMore Actors\nMusiciansExpand (448)\nAll Musicians (448)\nMadonna (129)\nBritney Spears (99)\nKylie Minogue (52)\nPink (44)\nAmy Winehouse (39)\nKevin Federline (28)\nRihanna (28)\nJessica Alba (21)\nChris Brown (21)\nJustin Timberlake (18)\nFergie (15)\nBeyonce Knowles (10)\nCourtney Love (10)\nChris Martin (10)\nChristina Aguilera (5)\nRobbie Williams (5)\nGwen Stefani (5)\nMore Musicians\nPrivate SydneyExpand (43)\nAll Private Sydney (43)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nSandra Bullock\u0027s husband hounded by women\n22 Mar\nSandra Bullock\u0027s husband Jesse James \"heavily targeted\" by women.\nClick to play video\nVideo\nBullock looks for divorce lawyer\nSHOWBIZ NEWS: Sandra Bullock shops for lawyers, Akon refused entry into Sri Lanka and Janet Jackson promotes new film.\nPhoto Galleries\nCelebrity Red Carpet Watch\nView with a room\nThe bold and the beautiful\nMelbourne Fashion Festival - Day 2\nMelbourne Fashion Festival - Day 1\nFashion at the Oscars\nBlogs\nLatest blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nShould they tax second-hand games?\nMarch 23rd\nMarch 21st\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution\nMore blogs\nComments\nLatest comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) Maximus III Gene Motherboard  ...\nWill Facebook be more bigger than Google?\nWinners of EeePC Seashell 1001HA\nMore forums\nLatest\nFeatured products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nEAH5850 DirectCU TOP/2DIS/1GD5\nUnrivalled visual quality and intense gaming performance with DX11\nMore products\nNews\nLatest news\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nLiving in the lap of luxury\nMarch 16th\nMarch 11th\nOut with the old, or in with repairs?\nMore news\nHoroscopes\nAquarius: The layout of the day suggests that you must honour your commitments and those who have more knowledge or authority than you and to not be impulsive where money, finances and personal resources are concerned.

High heels instantly became a symbol of status - that is, until the 1950s, when the loafer and ballet flat became chic once more thanks to style icons such as Audrey Hepburn.\nWhy you need it now\nThe dizzying heights of last season\u0027s heels have given way to a flat trend and when Rodarte teams up with Repetto to create ballet flats and brogues, something is abuzz. With a flood of fabulous flat styles in stores - from the classic ballet, to the \u002780s brogue and the weekend loafer - there\u0027s no excuse not to give the stilettos a break.\nWhat to look for\nThe latest in flats is a retro-meets-modern statement. Marc Jacobs always seduces with a ballet flat. This season it has a flat, thick wooden sole, ankle tie and metallic finish. Nicholas Kirkwood has offered a feminine take on the masculine brogue, with a deconstructed shoe complete with cut-outs. Ralph Lauren has done a slender take on the traditional with charming success (there are hints of Katharine Hepburn) and Miu Miu dazzles with a shimmering bowling-style number. Loafers add a preppy feel. Tod\u0027s is showcasing pastels and Gucci\u0027s tan loafer with horse-bit is a lasting country-esque classic. Rubber soles keep you sure-footed so get them resoled if they are leather. Padded or cork linings buffer the foot from hard surfaces. Look for a firm fit as most will stretch. Always make sure your toes have room and heels are soft. Leather or suede breathe best and also equal fewer blisters so shell out the extra for them if you can.\nStyle to suit you\nPetite feet, keep an eye out for styles that add length like ballet flats with a little toe cleavage, however avoid ankle straps that separate the leg from the foot. Otherwise, a clunky man-style looks super-sweet on you.\nWide feet, look for styles that support the foot while streamlining it. High sides keep the foot snug and looking lean. The more material on top of the shoe, the longer and leaner your foot will appear so consider brogues with punched patterns or fuller, stiffer ballet flats.\nBig sizes, steer clear of elongated toes - go for a rounded toe instead. Dark, rich colours give the illusion of a smaller size and small accents such as bows, buckles and lace break up the expanse.\nThin feet, you can wear brogues and loafers well as they add substance. Beware when trying ballet flats as they always stretch so look for an ankle tie.\nWhere to shop\nGucci, Salvatore Ferragamo, Miu Miu and Bally for a luxe loafer.\nRepetto or Chanel for iconic ballet flats. Also try French Sole and Country Road. Bloch does delicate ballets and brogues. Ralph Lauren and Church\u0027s have stylish brogues and check out Camper\u0027s quirky version.\nFive more ways to wear\nWeekender \u003d FS with jeans, tee and oversized knit.\nWorkwear \u003d FS with tailored pants, blouse and ladylike bag.\nUrban flair \u003d FS with leggings, long shirt, blazer and woollen scarf.\nDay tripping \u003d FS with full skirt, tight tank top, wide belt and cropped jacket.\nSmart casual \u003d FS with day dress under utility jacket.\nComments\n4 comments so far\nalso try www.fancyflats.com\nthey are my new faves, sooo comfortable and the fold in your bag so easy to pack multiple pairs in different colours for the weekend away or staying at your boyfriends etc. Hope this helps other flats lovers out there!\nShoe Lover | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 1:09PM\ngood for oldies, the unsteady of foot have never look or felt so with it!\nrosy@kempsey - March 25, 2010, 2:54PM\nAs a sufferer of Morton\u0027s neuroma (look it up ladies) as a result of years of wearing high heels, I welcome the change in style.

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

This New Year\u0027s resolution wasn\u0027t only about vanity, oh no. Governments tells us obesity has a \u0027\u0027severe impact\u0027\u0027 on our health and puts a \u0027\u0027significant burden on the health service\u0027\u0027. So slimming, it seems, is practically a patriotic duty.\nIf the lard is already melting away, then lucky you. But what if the exercise doesn\u0027t seem to be working? What if you can now run a kilometre without so much as puffing, yet your weight has hardly changed? Are you a lost cause? Or is it possible to be both fat and fit - not just fit enough to exercise but fit enough to live as long as someone a lot lighter?\nNot according to a study in 2004 from the Harvard School of Public Health, which looked at 115,000 nurses aged between 30 and 55. Compared with women who were both thin and active (that is, who reported taking 150 minutes or more of exercise a week), researchers found the mortality rate in women who were obese but active was 91 per cent higher. Though far better than the inactive obese (142 per cent higher), they were still worse off than the inactive lean (5 per cent higher).\n\u0027\u0027This data does not support the hypothesis that if you are physically active, you don\u0027t have to worry about your weight,\u0027\u0027 was the verdict from Frank Hu, who led the study.\nA similar picture emerged in 2008 after Harvard-affiliated researchers examined 39,000 women with an average age of 54. Next to active women of normal weight, the active but overweight were 54 per cent more likely to develop heart disease, while the active but obese were in 87 per cent greater danger.\n\u0027\u0027Even high quantities of physical activity are unlikely to fully reverse the risk of coronary heart disease in overweight and obese women without concurrent weight loss,\u0027\u0027 the authors found.\nThat\u0027s that settled, then. Or is it? Steven Blair is professor of exercise science at the University of South Carolina. He describes the official focus on obesity as an \u0027\u0027obsession â€¦ and it\u0027s not grounded in solid data\u0027\u0027.\nBlair\u0027s most fascinating study, in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 2007, took 2600 people aged 60 and above, of various degrees of fatness, and tested their fitness on the treadmill, rather than asking them to quantify it themselves.\nThis is an unusually rigorous approach, he says, since many rival surveys ask participants to assess their own fitness, or ignore it as a factor altogether. Proper tests, Blair says, demonstrate no hard and fast link between excess weight and increased mortality.\n\u0027\u0027There is an \u0027association\u0027 between obesity and fitness,\u0027\u0027 he says,  \u0027\u0027but it is not perfect. If you look at the normal-weight men and women aged 60 and older, for example, about 90 per cent are fit as demonstrated by a \u0027maximal exercise\u0027 test in the laboratory.\n\u0027\u0027This is not asking them if they\u0027re fit, or guessing that they\u0027re fit. They\u0027ve proved it on the treadmill. As you progress towards overweight, class 1 obesity and class 2 obesity, the percentage of individuals who are fit does go down. But here\u0027s a shock: among class 2 obese individuals [with a body mass index of between 35 and 39.9], about 40 or 45 per cent are still fit. You simply cannot tell by looking whether someone is fit or not.\u0027\u0027\nBut doesn\u0027t that prove that some fat people can hold their own on the treadmill? Not at all, Blair says. \u0027\u0027In all of these studies, we typically see higher rates of mortality, chronic diseases, heart attacks and the like, in people with high BMI - we see the same thing that everybody else sees.\n\u0027\u0027But when we look at these mortality rates in fat people who are fit, we see the harmful effect of fat just disappears. If we look at individuals who are obese and just moderately fit - we\u0027re not talking about marathon runners here - their death rate during the next decade is half that of the normal-weight people who are unfit. So it\u0027s a huge effect.\u0027\u0027\nOne day - probably about 100 years from now - this fat-but-fit question will be answered without the shadow of a doubt. In the meantime, is there anything all the experts agree on? Oh yes, however much your body weighs, you\u0027ll live longer if you move it around a bit.\nGuardian News \u0026 Media\nComments\n9 comments so far\nFinally someone saying weight alone is not a perfect indicator of health. I am over the recommended BMI but eat a high proportion of fruit and vegies and exercise more than 400 mins each week. I haven\u0027t needed to see a doctor in more than 5 years and the only time I\u0027ve been in hospital was when I was born (now late 40s). My family are traditionally larger, but again eat healthy food and have few health problems. Our family norm life expectancy has been 80+ for the last few gens. My sister-in-law is one of those who can eat anything without putting on an ounce. Whilst she eats healthily \u0026 exercises, her father with a similar metabolism hated vegetables and lived on fried food. He always had a cold and was at the doctors every few days with some sort of ailment, but as he was in the healthy BMI range, the doctor didn\u0027t suspect diet issues - he died of a massive heart attack in his 50s. I get fed up with people accusing me of being lazy and making poor lifestyle choices when I\u0027m probably healthier than most, despite my larger size.\nLife isn\u0027t black and white | Canberra             - March 25, 2010, 10:36AM\nI agree, Life isn\u0027t black and white.\nI am fitter than I have ever been in my adult life. I play soccer, netball and I walk, jog and go to the gym. I also work in a shop and am on my feet for my entire shift.\nI am just bordering on obese, according to my BMI. I went bushwalking with a thin friend who huffed and puffed back up the hill and had aching legs for two days afterwards. I huffed a little with the exertion, but found that I recovered very quickly and had no aches at all.\nI know I am a carb addict and I have been dieting for 10+ years, yo-yo-ing wildly and doing more damage to my body. I decided late last year that this was going to be the first New Year\u0027s Resolution that did not involve losing weight.\nIt seems that no matter how much I exercise, I can\u0027t lose the weight. So I am at a level of acceptance and am tired of beating myself up for being 15kg overweight. I will lose the weight, but gradually. I am tired of deprivation, diets and weight loss regimes that do not work, and obsessing about every bit of food I eat.\nEnough.\nGC | The Internizzle             - March 25, 2010, 12:14PM\nAccording to a recent article in New Scientist, the fat that actually does the damage is the fat in your blood, not the fat around your thighs:\nhttp://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527513.700-obesity-food-kills-flab-protects.html\nSaturated fats in the blood seem to accumulate in organs and provoke an immune reaction (inflammation). The catch is though that the more you overload your fat cells, the more likely it is that they\u0027ll release their loads into your blood stream.\nPresumably, when these overloaded fat cells are around your waist and under your skin (around your vital organs) the released fat can do damage much more easily. Having a waist over 80cm (female) or 94cm (male) is certainly highly correlated with poor health outcomes, apparently even more than BMI or overall body fat.\nThough the conclusion from all of this is still that being too fat is dangerous and that eating saturated fats is bad for you.\nAnna | Melbourne             - March 25, 2010, 12:13PM\nYou know what\u0027s better for you than being fit and fat? Being a healthy weight and being fit. No matter what people tell themselves, being fat is not good for the body. Also, there is no such thing as being fat and eating nothing. The whole concept defies the basic laws of physics. If you\u0027re overweight, eat less. You might have to eat less than the person next to you. It sucks, but if you want to be healthy you\u0027re going to have to deal with it.\nHealthy | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 3:22PM\n@ healthy: you are a fool. \u0027dieting\u0027 ruins your metabolism, meaning that eating less doens\u0027t really help. I eat quite a bit less than some of my slimmer friends. I\u0027m also more active than them. Yet I\u0027m still overweight.\nAnd you know what else *really* doesn\u0027t help? Being told constantly, that you are fat, and worthless, and stupid, mostly by people who\u0027ve never had a weight problem in their life. Do this, do that, no do this, no that\u0027s wrong, do that! Personally I\u0027d prefer to be a couple of kilos overweight and happy, than constantly trying to \u0027do the right thing\u0027 which changes every second week anyway, and being forever afraid of food and my weight. There are more important things.\nSarah - March 25, 2010, 4:22PM\nNot really on topic but I started putting a few kg\u0027s on recently so I put myself on the easiest programme ever I call it the WWW programme - WheatBix, Walking and Wasabi. This one consists of 3 wheatbix for breakfast, 2 pieces of sushi for lunch and walking around the park for half an hour a day - I\u0027ve lost 3 - 4kgs already and it requires virtually no effort at all.\nMikka | Brisbane             - March 25, 2010, 5:14PM\nI am a weight loss coach and I use an ELG (Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis) and software program that accurately measures a person body fat and lean muscle bevause BMI is not an accurate measurement of determining a person\u0027s obesity level. BMI was first developed as an insurance tool to assess risk and should not really be used to measure a person state of health (eg obesity). My father always looked heavy and his BMI is very high however, his ELG results puts him in a healthy weight range. There are people who are heavy and very healthy (low body fat) and there are others who have low BMI but are very high in body fat. I believe we should not use BMI as the all or none indicator but as a first basic step. There are more accurate ways to measure health and obesity which we should implement so more accurate information is given to people. This will help prevent much of the confusion such as being both fat and healthy.\nHealthy Changes | Epping             - March 26, 2010, 7:25AM\nThis article just goes to show that if you look hard enough you can find \"evidence\" to support any position that you want to promote.\nStudies with 115000 and 39000 participants prove that obesity increases morbidity and mortality but because a trial with only 2600 people (all over 60) showed no difference people will jump on this to normalise their obesity. As \"Healthy\" pointed out, it would be far more useful to take heed of the studies with some validity and realise that you will always be better off to be in the healthy weight range than being overweight or obese.\nAs an aside, I\u0027m anxiously awaiting the day when one of the worlds major energy companies comes out with \"Fat-Tech\", a revolutionary process of energy production based on the widely (self) reported phenomenon of obese people who \"eat less and exercise more\" than their thinner counterparts and remain overweight...\nStealth - March 26, 2010, 2:25AM\n1st prize to the fit and thin, 2nd prize to the fit and fat, third prize the unfit and thin and the wooden spoon goes to.........\nslb34 - March 25, 2010, 5:45PM\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you.

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you.

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday.

You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you.

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day.

You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that).

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you.

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated.

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMotoring\nSubaru WRX gets fat\nDrive.com.au\nThe most reliable cars\nSaab restarts production\nSell your car for just $40!\nJobs\nMonthly payments could mean a super bonus\nMycareer.com.au\nWIN a job as Nova\u0027s CEO\nVisit our Salary Centre\n$100k+ Executive jobs\nReal Estate\nWin a $5,000 shopping spree in New York\nDomain.com.au\nBuy real estate\nFirst Home Buyers Guide\nTough times to stay\nManaged Funds\nSet up a FREE Personalised Investment Alert!\nManaged funds, shares...\nFind a managed fund\nMorningstar rated funds\nEssential Baby\nDo NOT bring your kids!\nwww.essentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nCompare and Save\nBroadband\nEnergy\nMobile\nHome Loans\nSavings Accounts\nCredit Card Heaven\nSpend hard, play hard, credit cards.\nCompare all Credit Cards\nCheaper Home Loans\nChop your loan down to size - low fees and lower rates!\nCompare all Home loans\nHigh Interest Accounts\nAustraliaâ€™s most wanted savings account just hit 5.95%\nCompare all Savings Accounts\nUnlimited Plans on iPhone\nCarriers update their iPhone plans with unlimited calling options.\nCompare Mobile Phones \u0026 Plans\niPad 3G - Be First\nBe the first to get an iPad 3G on a mobile broadband plan.\nCompare all Broadband Plans\nReaders\u0027 most viewed\nMost viewed articles on Brisbane Times\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nMost viewed articles on WA Today\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nAlison Braun enjoys high tea at low weight\nFun flirtation or hurtful cheating?\nHigh tea in fashion\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nMost viewed articles on The Age\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nFabulous flats\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nMost viewed articles on The Sydney Morning Herald\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nVideos\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nBye Mr Shuffles, Hello Pathi Harn\nHot lap: Albert Park in 200 km/h Merc\nMan fined for tooting horn\nEddie regrets gay remarks\nSMH Home\nNSW\nNational\nWorld\nEnvironment\nOpinion\nBusiness\nTechnology\nDigital Life\nEntertainment\nLife \u0026 Style\nTravel\nCars\nExec Style\nSport\nWeather\nSydney Morning Herald\nSitemap\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPrivacy\nConditions\nAdvertise with Us\nPhoto Sales\nProducts \u0026 Services\nAM Today\nLast 8 days\nHigh Contrast\nText\nNewspaper subscription\nShop\nSEO\nConnect\nMobile\nNewsletters\nRSS\nTwitter\nFacebook\nClassifieds\nAccommodation\nCars\nDating\nJobs\nReal Estate\nProperty Price Data\nTributes \u0026 Celebrations\nPlace an ad\nOur Sites\nThe Age\nSydney Morning Herald\nWA Today\nBrisbane Times\nBusiness Day\nMoney Manager\nInvestSMART\nÂ \nTrading Room\nRugby Heaven\nLeague HQ\nReal Footy\nWeatherZone\nEssential Baby\nFairfax Digital Network\nFairfax Digital\nCopyright Â©\nFairfax Digital\n",

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMotoring\nSubaru WRX gets fat\nDrive.com.au\nThe most reliable cars\nSaab restarts production\nSell your car for just $40!\nJobs\nMonthly payments could mean a super bonus\nMycareer.com.au\nWIN a job as Nova\u0027s CEO\nVisit our Salary Centre\n$100k+ Executive jobs\nReal Estate\nWin a $5,000 shopping spree in New York\nDomain.com.au\nBuy real estate\nFirst Home Buyers Guide\nTough times to stay\nManaged Funds\nSet up a FREE Personalised Investment Alert!\nManaged funds, shares...\nFind a managed fund\nMorningstar rated funds\nEssential Baby\nDo NOT bring your kids!\nwww.essentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nCompare and Save\nBroadband\nEnergy\nMobile\nHome Loans\nSavings Accounts\nCredit Card Heaven\nSpend hard, play hard, credit cards.\nCompare all Credit Cards\nCheaper Home Loans\nChop your loan down to size - low fees and lower rates!\nCompare all Home loans\nHigh Interest Accounts\nAustraliaâ€™s most wanted savings account just hit 5.95%\nCompare all Savings Accounts\nUnlimited Plans on iPhone\nCarriers update their iPhone plans with unlimited calling options.\nCompare Mobile Phones \u0026 Plans\niPad 3G - Be First\nBe the first to get an iPad 3G on a mobile broadband plan.\nCompare all Broadband Plans\nReaders\u0027 most viewed\nMost viewed articles on Brisbane Times\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nMost viewed articles on WA Today\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nAlison Braun enjoys high tea at low weight\nFun flirtation or hurtful cheating?\nHigh tea in fashion\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nMost viewed articles on The Age\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nFabulous flats\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nMost viewed articles on The Sydney Morning Herald\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nVideos\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nBye Mr Shuffles, Hello Pathi Harn\nHot lap: Albert Park in 200 km/h Merc\nMan fined for tooting horn\nEddie regrets gay remarks\nSMH Home\nNSW\nNational\nWorld\nEnvironment\nOpinion\nBusiness\nTechnology\nDigital Life\nEntertainment\nLife \u0026 Style\nTravel\nCars\nExec Style\nSport\nWeather\nSydney Morning Herald\nSitemap\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPrivacy\nConditions\nAdvertise with Us\nPhoto Sales\nProducts \u0026 Services\nAM Today\nLast 8 days\nHigh Contrast\nText\nNewspaper subscription\nShop\nSEO\nConnect\nMobile\nNewsletters\nRSS\nTwitter\nFacebook\nClassifieds\nAccommodation\nCars\nDating\nJobs\nReal Estate\nProperty Price Data\nTributes \u0026 Celebrations\nPlace an ad\nOur Sites\nThe Age\nSydney Morning Herald\nWA Today\nBrisbane Times\nBusiness Day\nMoney Manager\nInvestSMART\nÂ \nTrading Room\nRugby Heaven\nLeague HQ\nReal Footy\nWeatherZone\nEssential Baby\nFairfax Digital Network\nFairfax Digital\nCopyright Â©\nFairfax Digital\n",

Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMotoring\nSubaru WRX gets fat\nDrive.com.au\nThe most reliable cars\nSaab restarts production\nSell your car for just $40!\nJobs\nMonthly payments could mean a super bonus\nMycareer.com.au\nWIN a job as Nova\u0027s CEO\nVisit our Salary Centre\n$100k+ Executive jobs\nReal Estate\nWin a $5,000 shopping spree in New York\nDomain.com.au\nBuy real estate\nFirst Home Buyers Guide\nTough times to stay\nManaged Funds\nSet up a FREE Personalised Investment Alert!\nManaged funds, shares...\nFind a managed fund\nMorningstar rated funds\nEssential Baby\nDo NOT bring your kids!\nwww.essentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nCompare and Save\nBroadband\nEnergy\nMobile\nHome Loans\nSavings Accounts\nCredit Card Heaven\nSpend hard, play hard, credit cards.\nCompare all Credit Cards\nCheaper Home Loans\nChop your loan down to size - low fees and lower rates!\nCompare all Home loans\nHigh Interest Accounts\nAustraliaâ€™s most wanted savings account just hit 5.95%\nCompare all Savings Accounts\nUnlimited Plans on iPhone\nCarriers update their iPhone plans with unlimited calling options.\nCompare Mobile Phones \u0026 Plans\niPad 3G - Be First\nBe the first to get an iPad 3G on a mobile broadband plan.\nCompare all Broadband Plans\nReaders\u0027 most viewed\nMost viewed articles on Brisbane Times\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nMost viewed articles on WA Today\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nAlison Braun enjoys high tea at low weight\nFun flirtation or hurtful cheating?\nHigh tea in fashion\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nMost viewed articles on The Age\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nFabulous flats\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nMost viewed articles on The Sydney Morning Herald\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nVideos\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nBye Mr Shuffles, Hello Pathi Harn\nHot lap: Albert Park in 200 km/h Merc\nMan fined for tooting horn\nEddie regrets gay remarks\nSMH Home\nNSW\nNational\nWorld\nEnvironment\nOpinion\nBusiness\nTechnology\nDigital Life\nEntertainment\nLife \u0026 Style\nTravel\nCars\nExec Style\nSport\nWeather\nSydney Morning Herald\nSitemap\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPrivacy\nConditions\nAdvertise with Us\nPhoto Sales\nProducts \u0026 Services\nAM Today\nLast 8 days\nHigh Contrast\nText\nNewspaper subscription\nShop\nSEO\nConnect\nMobile\nNewsletters\nRSS\nTwitter\nFacebook\nClassifieds\nAccommodation\nCars\nDating\nJobs\nReal Estate\nProperty Price Data\nTributes \u0026 Celebrations\nPlace an ad\nOur Sites\nThe Age\nSydney Morning Herald\nWA Today\nBrisbane Times\nBusiness Day\nMoney Manager\nInvestSMART\nÂ \nTrading Room\nRugby Heaven\nLeague HQ\nReal Footy\nWeatherZone\nEssential Baby\nFairfax Digital Network\nFairfax Digital\nCopyright Â©\nFairfax Digital\n",

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday.

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMotoring\nSubaru WRX gets fat\nDrive.com.au\nThe most reliable cars\nSaab restarts production\nSell your car for just $40!\nJobs\nMonthly payments could mean a super bonus\nMycareer.com.au\nWIN a job as Nova\u0027s CEO\nVisit our Salary Centre\n$100k+ Executive jobs\nReal Estate\nCredit union cuts rates\nDomain.com.au\nBuy real estate\nDo the research before you bid\nWin a trip on the Orient Express\nManaged Funds\nSet up a FREE Personalised Investment Alert!\nManaged funds, shares...\nFind a managed fund\nMorningstar rated funds\nEssential Baby\nDo NOT bring your kids!\nwww.essentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nCompare and Save\nBroadband\nEnergy\nMobile\nHome Loans\nSavings Accounts\nCredit Card Heaven\nSpend hard, play hard, credit cards.\nCompare all Credit Cards\nCheaper Home Loans\nChop your loan down to size - low fees and lower rates!\nCompare all Home loans\nHigh Interest Accounts\nAustraliaâ€™s most wanted savings account just hit 5.95%\nCompare all Savings Accounts\nUnlimited Plans on iPhone\nCarriers update their iPhone plans with unlimited calling options.\nCompare Mobile Phones \u0026 Plans\niPad 3G - Be First\nBe the first to get an iPad 3G on a mobile broadband plan.\nCompare all Broadband Plans\nReaders\u0027 most viewed\nMost viewed articles on Brisbane Times\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nMost viewed articles on WA Today\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nAlison Braun enjoys high tea at low weight\nFun flirtation or hurtful cheating?\nHigh tea in fashion\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nMost viewed articles on The Age\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nFabulous flats\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nMost viewed articles on The Sydney Morning Herald\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nVideos\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nBye Mr Shuffles, Hello Pathi Harn\nHot lap: Albert Park in 200 km/h Merc\nMan fined for tooting horn\nEddie regrets gay remarks\nSMH Home\nNSW\nNational\nWorld\nEnvironment\nOpinion\nBusiness\nTechnology\nDigital Life\nEntertainment\nLife \u0026 Style\nTravel\nCars\nExec Style\nSport\nWeather\nSydney Morning Herald\nSitemap\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPrivacy\nConditions\nAdvertise with Us\nPhoto Sales\nProducts \u0026 Services\nAM Today\nLast 8 days\nHigh Contrast\nText\nNewspaper subscription\nShop\nSEO\nConnect\nMobile\nNewsletters\nRSS\nTwitter\nFacebook\nClassifieds\nAccommodation\nCars\nDating\nJobs\nReal Estate\nProperty Price Data\nTributes \u0026 Celebrations\nPlace an ad\nOur Sites\nThe Age\nSydney Morning Herald\nWA Today\nBrisbane Times\nBusiness Day\nMoney Manager\nInvestSMART\nÂ \nTrading Room\nRugby Heaven\nLeague HQ\nReal Footy\nWeatherZone\nEssential Baby\nFairfax Digital Network\nFairfax Digital\nCopyright Â©\nFairfax Digital\n",

Photo: Ben Rushton\nGOAT ISLAND has no shortage of historical attractions, from the Powder Magazine, which housed  gunpowder supplies, to the 19th century guard\u0027s barracks and the water police station.\nBut on Saturday night the island\u0027s most appealing attraction will be its location: with the central business district to the right, North Sydney business district to the left and the Harbour Bridge in the middle, it will provide the ideal spot to view Earth Hour.\nThis year, for the first time, the island is open to the public to share the first-class view of the city\u0027s buildings as they turn out the lights.\nFrom mid-afternoon ferries will take visitors from Circular Quay to the island. National Parks will offer tours of the historic buildings, including the gunpowder depot, which was built in 1838 and, at its peak, held over 7000 barrels of gunpowder. Guy Fawkes, in comparison, intended to use just 36 barrels to blow up the British Houses of Parliament.\nThe water police station was also built in 1838 and housed a single officer who, while on duty, was transported around the harbour by convicts. Authorities constructed a moat between the station and the rest of the island to dissuade the convicts from raiding the gunpowder. The moat is still visible.\nThere is also the magnificent harbour master\u0027s residence, completed in 1903 with a commanding view out the heads.\nOn Saturday the NSW Environment Department will have information stalls and interactive displays on sustainable living, as well as details of the various government rebates for solar hot water, water tanks, efficient toilets and washing machines.\nVisitors are encouraged to bring a picnic. There will be entertainment and, at 8.30pm, a city in darkness.\nTickets are $30 adults, $22 children or $90 for a family of four. Bookings are essential.\nwww.earthhour.org.au/latest-news/sydney-earth-hour-event-goat-island\nJoin the conversation\n2 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 133 people read this\nWoman \u0027ogled\u0027: airport worker warned over ... 27 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 155 people read this\nPay to play games with girls 10 people read this\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ... 85 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nEarth Hour supporters left in the dark\nA think tank founded and chaired by the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi ...\nTop Environment articles\nMiracle baby elephant gets miracle name\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay\nRising sea level settles border dispute\nVets warn of doggy death by chocolate\nParched farmers vote to abandon irrigation\nMore Environment articles\nEnvironment Topics\nClimateExpand (827)\nAll Climate (827)\nClimate Change (470)\nEmissions Trading (179)\nGreenhouse Gas (156)\nWeather (148)\nGlobal Warming (135)\nRain (130)\nDrought (109)\nCold (66)\nIce (61)\nFlood (56)\nTsunami (52)\nEarthquake (48)\nFossil Fuels (21)\nSea Level Rise (16)\nOcean Acidification (5)\nTyphoon (5)\nHurricane (2)\nMore Climate\nResourcesExpand (608)\nAll Resources (608)\nWater (377)\nWhaling (63)\nRenewable Energy (55)\nFishing (42)\nEnergy Efficiency (40)\nMining (39)\nFarming (35)\nSustainability (35)\nDams (28)\nRecycling (24)\nDeforestation (23)\nIrrigation (16)\nPlastic (11)\nOverfishing (8)\nIllegal Logging (6)\nConsumerism (2)\nOver-consumption (1)\nMore Resources\nConservationExpand (484)\nAll Conservation (484)\nFish (85)\nWildlife (70)\nNature (65)\nRivers (50)\nWhales (49)\nPlaces (40)\nMountains (38)\nHabitat (37)\nBirds (34)\nNational Parks (32)\nEndangered Species (30)\nGlaciers (29)\nExtinction (27)\nErosion (24)\nLakes (20)\nSharks (19)\nTurtles (18)\nEarth Hour (13)\nSnakes (13)\nKoalas (12)\nDolphins (11)\nCats (11)\nKangaroos (11)\nPoaching (7)\nRainforests (7)\nFoxes (7)\nCrocodiles (5)\nInvasive Species (4)\nRabbits (4)\nDesertification (3)\nDugongs (3)\nCoral Bleaching (2)\nBats (2)\nCane Toads (2)\nIntroduced Species (2)\nWombats (1)\nDeserts (1)\nUrban Sprawl (1)\nMore Conservation\nPollutionExpand (212)\nAll Pollution (212)\nLight (57)\nRecycling (24)\nNoise (16)\nNuclear Power (15)\nAir Quality (13)\nLandfill (13)\nOcean Acidification (5)\nSmog (5)\nPesticides (5)\nLitter (4)\nHeavy Metals (3)\nToxic Waste (3)\nHerbicides (2)\nE-waste (2)\nParticulate Matter (2)\nOil Spills (2)\nRadioactive Waste (2)\nPcb (2)\nOzone Depletion (2)\nChlorofluorocarbons (1)\nAcid Rain (1)\nDioxin (1)\nMore Pollution\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nEarth Hour supporters left in the dark\nA think tank founded and chaired by the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi has launched a campaign to promote an anti-Earth Hour event - urging people to turn their lights on.\nLatest videos\nEnvironment News Video More video\nTrapped gases in artic permafrost\nThe permafrost is melting in artic regions, releasing trapped methane gases, which are then thawing glaciers.\nPlay video\nArt atop a melting iceberg\nPlay video\nElephant rescues stumbling Mr Shuffles\nPlay video\nJapan won\u0027t comply on tuna ban\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

Turn your lights on!\u0027\u0027\nSenator Bernardi said yesterday the  campaign was not his idea and is being run by university students who volunteer at his think tank.\nHis connection to the campaign is likely to embarrass key Liberals, including the shadow environment minister, Greg Hunt, who  has pledged his support for Earth Hour.\nEarth Hour is organised by the WWF and sponsored by Fairfax, the owner of the Herald.\nThis year\u0027s Earth Hour, and Human Achievement Hour, will be held on Saturday between 8.30pm and 9.30pm.\nComments\nBe the first to comment.\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

The landmass had been claimed by both countries but Professor Hazra says satellite images prove it has gone.\n\u0027\u0027It is now a submerged landmass, not an island,\u0027\u0027 Professor Hazra told the Herald.\n\u0027\u0027Only small parts can be seen in very, very low tide conditions.\u0027\u0027\nSea-level rise caused by climate change was \u0027\u0027surely\u0027\u0027 a factor in the island\u0027s inundation, Professor Hazra said.\n\u0027\u0027The rate of sea-level rise in this part of the northern Bay of Bengal is definitely attributable to climate change,\u0027\u0027 he said.\n\u0027\u0027There is a close correlation between the rate of sea-level rise and the sea surface temperature.\u0027\u0027\nThe island was once about 3.5 kilometres  long and three kilometres wide and situated four kilometres from the mouth of the Hariabhanga River, the waterway that marks a stretch of the border between south-western Bangladesh and India.\nScientists believe the disputed island was formed  following a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal in 1970 and both countries laid claim to the land.\nBilateral negotiations   were inconclusive and in 1981 the Indian government sent gunboats to the island and members of its Border Security Forces planted an Indian flag there.\nThe island was not inhabited but Bangladeshi fishermen were reportedly sighted there frequently during the dry season.\n\u0027\u0027This is a unique instance of how climate resolves a dispute,\u0027\u0027 said Professor Hazra.\n\u0027\u0027It also goes to show how climate can affect all of us beyond geographical boundaries.\n\u0027\u0027The Indian government had once sent ships with guns to guard the island.\n\u0027\u0027Now one will have to think of sending submarines to mount a vigil there.\u0027\u0027\nProfessor Hazra said sea-level rise, changes in monsoonal rain patterns which altered river flows and land subsidence were all contributing to the inundation of land in the northern Bay of Bengal.\nThe low-lying delta region that makes up much of Bangladesh and the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal are acutely vulnerable to climate change.\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts rising sea levels will devour 17 per cent of Bangladesh by 2050, displacing at least 20 million people. More than 155 million people live in the country.\nThe Bangladesh non-governmental organisation Coastal Watch says an average of 11 Bangladeshis are  losing their homes to rising waters every hour.\nProfessor Hazra predicts that 15 per cent of the Indian Sundarbans region on the northern shore of the Bay of Bengal will be submerged by 2020.\n\u0027\u0027A lot of other islands are eroding very fast,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nThe cyclone-prone region is also likely to experience more frequent and extreme storms as the sea-water temperature in the Bay of Bengal rises due to global warming.\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 100 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 151 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 179 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 85 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 76 people read this\nTop Environment articles\nMiracle baby elephant gets miracle name\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay\nRising sea level settles border dispute\nVets warn of doggy death by chocolate\nParched farmers vote to abandon irrigation\nMore Environment articles\nEnvironment Topics\nClimateExpand (827)\nAll Climate (827)\nClimate Change (470)\nEmissions Trading (179)\nGreenhouse Gas (156)\nWeather (148)\nGlobal Warming (135)\nRain (130)\nDrought (109)\nCold (66)\nIce (61)\nFlood (56)\nTsunami (52)\nEarthquake (48)\nFossil Fuels (21)\nSea Level Rise (16)\nOcean Acidification (5)\nTyphoon (5)\nHurricane (2)\nMore Climate\nResourcesExpand (608)\nAll Resources (608)\nWater (377)\nWhaling (63)\nRenewable Energy (55)\nFishing (42)\nEnergy Efficiency (40)\nMining (39)\nFarming (35)\nSustainability (35)\nDams (28)\nRecycling (24)\nDeforestation (23)\nIrrigation (16)\nPlastic (11)\nOverfishing (8)\nIllegal Logging (6)\nConsumerism (2)\nOver-consumption (1)\nMore Resources\nConservationExpand (484)\nAll Conservation (484)\nFish (85)\nWildlife (70)\nNature (65)\nRivers (50)\nWhales (49)\nPlaces (40)\nMountains (38)\nHabitat (37)\nBirds (34)\nNational Parks (32)\nEndangered Species (30)\nGlaciers (29)\nExtinction (27)\nErosion (24)\nLakes (20)\nSharks (19)\nTurtles (18)\nEarth Hour (13)\nSnakes (13)\nKoalas (12)\nDolphins (11)\nCats (11)\nKangaroos (11)\nPoaching (7)\nRainforests (7)\nFoxes (7)\nCrocodiles (5)\nInvasive Species (4)\nRabbits (4)\nDesertification (3)\nDugongs (3)\nCoral Bleaching (2)\nBats (2)\nCane Toads (2)\nIntroduced Species (2)\nWombats (1)\nDeserts (1)\nUrban Sprawl (1)\nMore Conservation\nPollutionExpand (212)\nAll Pollution (212)\nLight (57)\nRecycling (24)\nNoise (16)\nNuclear Power (15)\nAir Quality (13)\nLandfill (13)\nOcean Acidification (5)\nSmog (5)\nPesticides (5)\nLitter (4)\nHeavy Metals (3)\nToxic Waste (3)\nHerbicides (2)\nE-waste (2)\nParticulate Matter (2)\nOil Spills (2)\nRadioactive Waste (2)\nPcb (2)\nOzone Depletion (2)\nChlorofluorocarbons (1)\nAcid Rain (1)\nDioxin (1)\nMore Pollution\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest videos\nEnvironment News Video More video\nTrapped gases in artic permafrost\nThe permafrost is melting in artic regions, releasing trapped methane gases, which are then thawing glaciers.\nPlay video\nArt atop a melting iceberg\nPlay video\nElephant rescues stumbling Mr Shuffles\nPlay video\nJapan won\u0027t comply on tuna ban\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

Now evidence has been unearthed in Victoria that Australia had its very own tyrannosaur. It had the same little arms and powerful jaws, but it was a fraction of the size of its giant cousin T. rex.\nAn international research team discovered the fossilised hip bone of a tyrannosauroid  dinosaur that lived about 105 million years ago. It is the first evidence the predator existed in the southern continents.\n\"T. rex and his buddies were previously only known to the northern hemisphere; to find one anywhere in the southern hemisphere is a first,\" said Tom Rich, a senior curator at Museum Victoria. Dr Rich said the fossil was found at a well-known underground research site called Dinosaur Cove, about 220 kilometres west of Melbourne on the Victorian coast. The hip bone is believed to have come from a dinosaur that was about three metres long and weighed about 80 kilograms, a fraction of the size and weight of the T. rex.\n\"The bone is unambiguously identifiable as a tyrannosaur because these dinosaurs have very distinct hip bones,\" said Roger Benson, a researcher at the University of Cambridge.\nDr Rich said the dinosaur would have had a large head and small arms, characteristic features of tyrannosaurs.\nIn the middle of the Cretaceous period, 100 million years ago, when this dinosaur lived, Australia was still attached to Antarctica and lay much further south than now. Victoria was placed well inside the Antarctic Circle and daily temperatures were low, frigid even, says Dr Rich, whose findings are published in the journal Science.\nThe discovery of the tyrannosauroid fossil shows the group was not confined to just one half of the globe, but probably lived everywhere, he said. \"Fifty to 100 million years ago before [the time of T. rex], the continents were joined together in a vast land mass called Pangaea.\"\nJoin the conversation\n27 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 210 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 112 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 116 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 128 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 167 people read this\nTop World articles\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting\nSex games: dung beetle pulls 1141 times its own body weight\nRevealed: Australia\u0027s very own little tyrannosaur\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in advance of robbery\nHope found in tragic case of girl lost in Holocaust\nMore World articles\nWorld Topics\nPlacesExpand (30502)\nAll Places (30502)\nUS (17895)\nFrance (3957)\nChina (3515)\nLondon (3325)\nAfghanistan (2680)\nNew York (2434)\nGermany (2332)\nJapan (2096)\nPakistan (2055)\nNew Zealand (1951)\nIndia (1866)\nIran (1734)\nItaly (1650)\nIraq (1599)\nBeijing (1557)\nParis (1522)\nSpain (1516)\nSouth Africa (1480)\nIsrael (1407)\nCanada (1196)\nIndonesia (1005)\nLos Angeles (957)\nIreland (930)\nUK (814)\nNorth Korea (789)\nKabul (684)\nTokyo (669)\nBerlin (661)\nBaghdad (611)\nRome (598)\nSingapore (572)\nThailand (547)\nPhilippines (530)\nJakarta (527)\nPyongyang (492)\nJerusalem (482)\nDelhi (420)\nAuckland (386)\nCuba (379)\nMalaysia (355)\nHamilton (324)\nWellington (309)\nBangkok (304)\nMumbai (296)\nJohannesburg (215)\nManila (209)\nPapua New Guinea (202)\nLahore (198)\nCape Town (153)\nTel Aviv (129)\nChristchurch (122)\nEast Timor (119)\nPalestine (110)\nPort Moresby (109)\nPretoria (91)\nWashington DC (67)\nHavana (66)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (18086)\nAll People (18086)\nBarack Obama (4248)\nHillary Clinton (1001)\nGordon Brown (902)\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad (685)\nNicolas Sarkozy (554)\nBenjamin Netanyahu (461)\nRobert Gates (362)\nHu Jintao (263)\nSilvio Berlusconi (260)\nJoe Biden (254)\nDavid Miliband (246)\nVladimir Putin (239)\nFelipe Calderon (116)\nNancy Pelosi (115)\nTimothy Geithner (109)\nTaro Aso (108)\nJacob Zuma (106)\nAlistair Darling (103)\nMitch McConnell (99)\nJohn Key (86)\nSarah Palin (86)\nHarry Reid (85)\nNelson Mandela (79)\nEric Holder (79)\nKing Abdullah (77)\nNouri al-Maliki (76)\nShimon Peres (76)\nMichael Bloomberg (71)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4420)\nAll Organisations (4420)\nUnited Nations (1802)\nFBI (409)\nWorld Health Organisation (408)\nRed Cross (371)\nCIA (343)\nAmnesty International (228)\nWorld Bank (211)\nIMF (199)\nGreenpeace (118)\nMossad (91)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nWorld News Video More video\nPriest \u0027molested\u0027 deaf boys\nThe Vatican has defended its decision not to defrock an American priest accused of molesting some 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin.\nPlay video\nIsrael fail to reach agreement\nPlay video\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nPlay video\nStudents outraged at Ann Coulter\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?  ...\nMore blogs Â« Prev | Next Â»\nComments\nLatest Comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers  ...\nMore comments Â« Prev | Next Â»\nLatest\nFeatured Products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nMore products Â« Prev | Next Â»\nNews\nLatest News\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nImagine being able to read over 10,000 pages in  ...\nMore news Â« Prev | Next Â»\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

When the items arrived,  among them was a battered brown suitcase. Painted on it in thick white brushstrokes was the name Hanna Brady.\n\u0027\u0027It was the only object at our centre that had a name attached to it,\u0027\u0027 Ms Ishioka says.\nIn a bid to discover the identity of the suitcase\u0027s owner, she embarked on an amazing voyage of inquiry that crossed continents, languages and centuries. It entailed much  research, protracted email exchanges and numerous meetings with survivors of Auschwitz.\nHer efforts paid off.  Ms Ishioka uncovered Hana\u0027s identity (her name was misspelt on the suitcase); she found drawings by the young child, as well as records of her imprisonment in the Czech ghetto of Terezin.  Hana Brady, who hailed from a middle-class Jewish family in the Czech Republic, died in the gas chambers at Auschwitz, aged 13.\nA chance encounter led Ms Ishioka to George Brady, Hana\u0027s brother, who survived Auschwitz and was living in Toronto. \u0027\u0027Meeting George has been a life-affirming experience,\u0027\u0027 she says. \u0027\u0027Despite his terrible tragedy, he has never given up and has created such a beautiful family.\u0027\u0027\nWith his assistance,  Ms Ishioka discovered a tale that begins in a little town of Nove Mesto, continues with the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, and leads tragically to Auschwitz\u0027s gas chambers.\nMs Ishioka\u0027s research spawned the book Hana\u0027s Suitcase by Karen Levine, which has been translated into 40 languages and has garnered a slew of prizes.\nLarry Weinstein adapted Levine\u0027s work for film. Alongside George\u0027s memories, the docudrama features schoolchildren from Japan, Canada  and the Czech Republic narrating Hana\u0027s story in their own language.\nWith George\u0027s daughter, Lara Hana, Ms Ishioka has been touring Australia, speaking to students, both Jewish and non-Jewish. \u0027\u0027If we can prevent even one child from growing up a racist or a bigot, then we have done our job,\u0027\u0027 she says.\nJoin the conversation\n31 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 146 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 167 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 169 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 254 people read this\nSpicy sauce to punish children 87 people read this\nTop World articles\nSex games: dung beetle pulls 1141 times its own body weight\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting\nRevealed: Australia\u0027s very own little tyrannosaur\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in advance of robbery\nHope found in tragic case of girl lost in Holocaust\nMore World articles\nWorld Topics\nPlacesExpand (30502)\nAll Places (30502)\nUS (17895)\nFrance (3957)\nChina (3515)\nLondon (3325)\nAfghanistan (2680)\nNew York (2434)\nGermany (2332)\nJapan (2096)\nPakistan (2055)\nNew Zealand (1951)\nIndia (1866)\nIran (1734)\nItaly (1650)\nIraq (1599)\nBeijing (1557)\nParis (1522)\nSpain (1516)\nSouth Africa (1480)\nIsrael (1407)\nCanada (1196)\nIndonesia (1005)\nLos Angeles (957)\nIreland (930)\nUK (814)\nNorth Korea (789)\nKabul (684)\nTokyo (669)\nBerlin (661)\nBaghdad (611)\nRome (598)\nSingapore (572)\nThailand (547)\nPhilippines (530)\nJakarta (527)\nPyongyang (492)\nJerusalem (482)\nDelhi (420)\nAuckland (386)\nCuba (379)\nMalaysia (355)\nHamilton (324)\nWellington (309)\nBangkok (304)\nMumbai (296)\nJohannesburg (215)\nManila (209)\nPapua New Guinea (202)\nLahore (198)\nCape Town (153)\nTel Aviv (129)\nChristchurch (122)\nEast Timor (119)\nPalestine (110)\nPort Moresby (109)\nPretoria (91)\nWashington DC (67)\nHavana (66)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (18086)\nAll People (18086)\nBarack Obama (4248)\nHillary Clinton (1001)\nGordon Brown (902)\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad (685)\nNicolas Sarkozy (554)\nBenjamin Netanyahu (461)\nRobert Gates (362)\nHu Jintao (263)\nSilvio Berlusconi (260)\nJoe Biden (254)\nDavid Miliband (246)\nVladimir Putin (239)\nFelipe Calderon (116)\nNancy Pelosi (115)\nTimothy Geithner (109)\nTaro Aso (108)\nJacob Zuma (106)\nAlistair Darling (103)\nMitch McConnell (99)\nJohn Key (86)\nSarah Palin (86)\nHarry Reid (85)\nNelson Mandela (79)\nEric Holder (79)\nKing Abdullah (77)\nNouri al-Maliki (76)\nShimon Peres (76)\nMichael Bloomberg (71)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4420)\nAll Organisations (4420)\nUnited Nations (1802)\nFBI (409)\nWorld Health Organisation (408)\nRed Cross (371)\nCIA (343)\nAmnesty International (228)\nWorld Bank (211)\nIMF (199)\nGreenpeace (118)\nMossad (91)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nWorld News Video More video\nPriest \u0027molested\u0027 deaf boys\nThe Vatican has defended its decision not to defrock an American priest accused of molesting some 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin.\nPlay video\nIsrael fail to reach agreement\nPlay video\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nPlay video\nStudents outraged at Ann Coulter\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?  ...\nMore blogs Â« Prev | Next Â»\nComments\nLatest Comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers  ...\nMore comments Â« Prev | Next Â»\nLatest\nFeatured Products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nMore products Â« Prev | Next Â»\nNews\nLatest News\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nImagine being able to read over 10,000 pages in  ...\nMore news Â« Prev | Next Â»\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

US officials said the two met alone for about 90 minutes. Mr Netanyahu then huddled with  staff separately  for 90 minutes before requesting a second meeting with Mr Obama.\nWhen the President returned,  Mr Netanyahu is said to have made a counter-offer which Mr Obama did not accept.\nIn an Israeli TV interview before leaving  for Israel, Mr Netanyahu said he had made progress in his meeting with Mr Obama. \"I think we are finding the golden mean between the traditional policy of all the Israeli governments, and our desire to find a way to renew the peace process. I think we made progress today.\"\nRelations between Israel and the US were shaken this month when, during a visit  by the US Vice-President, Joe Biden, Israel  announced plans to build 1600 Jewish homes on Palestinian land in occupied East Jerusalem.\nOne congressman who met Mr Netanyahu after his White House meeting said: \u0027\u0027It was awful.  Netanyahu looked excessively concerned and upset. He waved around those pages, eager to persuade us that because of the complicated approval process for issuing construction permits in Jerusalem, one could never know in advance when a decision would be published on the issue.\u0027\u0027\nWriting in the Israeli Maariv, columnist Ben Caspit said there was no humiliation exercise the Americans did not try on Mr Netanyahu. \u0027\u0027Bibi received in the White House the treatment reserved for the president of Equatorial Guinea,\u0027\u0027 Caspit wrote.\nYedioth Ahronoth said the White House ambushed Mr Netanyahu. \u0027\u0027Everything was scrupulously planned, most likely, and the Israeli Premier, perhaps the most sought-after personage in the Oval Office in the past two decades, was received like the last of the wazirs from Lower Senegal.\u0027\u0027\nThe consensus among Israeli  commentators is that the US will continue to exert more pressure on Israel to move swiftly towards the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\u0027\u0027The US is abandoning us and effectively turning into Europe,\u0027\u0027 Caspit wrote. \u0027\u0027From now on, we are completely alone. The entire world, from one end to another, talks about a Palestinian state inside territory similar to 1967.\u0027\u0027\n\u0027\u0027Obama wants to know whether Netanyahu is there. In explicit words, in writing, not with hints, not with a \u0027maybe,\u0027 not with a \u0027yes, but\u0027. A simple question that requires a simple answer.\u0027\u0027\nUS and Israeli officials are  working on a document dubbed \u0027\u0027the blueprint,\u0027\u0027 which covers all issues, including Jerusalem, that need to be resolved to let talks go forward.\nMr Netanyahu will try to sell it to his cabinet while the US Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, will take it to Arab and Palestinian officials for approval.\nJoin the conversation\n95 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 115 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 158 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 106 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 95 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 84 people read this\nTop World articles\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting\nSex games: dung beetle pulls 1141 times its own body weight\nRevealed: Australia\u0027s very own little tyrannosaur\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in advance of robbery\nHope found in tragic case of girl lost in Holocaust\nMore World articles\nWorld Topics\nPlacesExpand (30502)\nAll Places (30502)\nUS (17895)\nFrance (3957)\nChina (3515)\nLondon (3325)\nAfghanistan (2680)\nNew York (2434)\nGermany (2332)\nJapan (2096)\nPakistan (2055)\nNew Zealand (1951)\nIndia (1866)\nIran (1734)\nItaly (1650)\nIraq (1599)\nBeijing (1557)\nParis (1522)\nSpain (1516)\nSouth Africa (1480)\nIsrael (1407)\nCanada (1196)\nIndonesia (1005)\nLos Angeles (957)\nIreland (930)\nUK (814)\nNorth Korea (789)\nKabul (684)\nTokyo (669)\nBerlin (661)\nBaghdad (611)\nRome (598)\nSingapore (572)\nThailand (547)\nPhilippines (530)\nJakarta (527)\nPyongyang (492)\nJerusalem (482)\nDelhi (420)\nAuckland (386)\nCuba (379)\nMalaysia (355)\nHamilton (324)\nWellington (309)\nBangkok (304)\nMumbai (296)\nJohannesburg (215)\nManila (209)\nPapua New Guinea (202)\nLahore (198)\nCape Town (153)\nTel Aviv (129)\nChristchurch (122)\nEast Timor (119)\nPalestine (110)\nPort Moresby (109)\nPretoria (91)\nWashington DC (67)\nHavana (66)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (18086)\nAll People (18086)\nBarack Obama (4248)\nHillary Clinton (1001)\nGordon Brown (902)\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad (685)\nNicolas Sarkozy (554)\nBenjamin Netanyahu (461)\nRobert Gates (362)\nHu Jintao (263)\nSilvio Berlusconi (260)\nJoe Biden (254)\nDavid Miliband (246)\nVladimir Putin (239)\nFelipe Calderon (116)\nNancy Pelosi (115)\nTimothy Geithner (109)\nTaro Aso (108)\nJacob Zuma (106)\nAlistair Darling (103)\nMitch McConnell (99)\nJohn Key (86)\nSarah Palin (86)\nHarry Reid (85)\nNelson Mandela (79)\nEric Holder (79)\nKing Abdullah (77)\nNouri al-Maliki (76)\nShimon Peres (76)\nMichael Bloomberg (71)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4420)\nAll Organisations (4420)\nUnited Nations (1802)\nFBI (409)\nWorld Health Organisation (408)\nRed Cross (371)\nCIA (343)\nAmnesty International (228)\nWorld Bank (211)\nIMF (199)\nGreenpeace (118)\nMossad (91)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nWorld News Video More video\nPriest \u0027molested\u0027 deaf boys\nThe Vatican has defended its decision not to defrock an American priest accused of molesting some 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin.\nPlay video\nIsrael fail to reach agreement\nPlay video\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nPlay video\nStudents outraged at Ann Coulter\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?  ...\nMore blogs Â« Prev | Next Â»\nComments\nLatest Comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers  ...\nMore comments Â« Prev | Next Â»\nLatest\nFeatured Products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nMore products Â« Prev | Next Â»\nNews\nLatest News\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nImagine being able to read over 10,000 pages in  ...\nMore news Â« Prev | Next Â»\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

In Kabul, he wore a heavy blue flak jacket over his suit while moving around the city in an armed convoy.\nThere was a media blackout until he left Afghanistan on Thursday to ensure his safety.\nHis younger son, Prince Harry, had to leave Afghanistan just 10 weeks into service on the frontline in February 2008 after the British media reported that he was in the country.\nCharles\u0027s sister, Princess Anne, also visited British troops in the south early this month.\nBritain has around 4,000 troops fighting in Operation Mushtarak - \"together\" in Dari and Pashto - which aims to clear insurgents and drug trafficking cartels out of key areas of Helmand province that have been under their control for more than two years.\nThe operation involves 15,000 US, NATO and Afghan troops in a key test of counter-insurgency tactics aimed at neutralising Taliban control in Helmand and neighbouring Kandahar province so that Afghan authority can be re-established.\nThere are currently more than 120,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan under US and NATO control.\nUnder the new strategy drawn up by US General Stanley McChrystal, commander of the combined international force, the number will peak at 150,000 by August, before a planned drawdown from mid-2011.\nMuch of Britain\u0027s effort has been concentrated in Sangin, a poppy-rich district in the central Helmand River valley, considered one of the toughest theatres for the British effort in Afghanistan.\nSangin is north of Nad Ali and Marjah where Mushtarak is under way.\nHomemade bombs known as improvised explosive devises - the Taliban weapon of choice - have been responsible for many of the 276 British troop deaths in the country, where about 10,000 British soldiers are deployed.\nDuring his visit, Charles met McChrystal for a briefing on the overall picture of the war in Afghanistan.\nHe also met British and Commonwealth troops serving in Kabul, as well as leaders in fields including environmental conservation, media, civic developments, architectural and archaeological heritage preservation.\nOn Thursday he travelled to Lashkar Gah, capital of Helmand, where he met Governor Gulab Mangal as well as military and civilian officials on Britain\u0027s provincial reconstruction team, involved in building up Afghanistan\u0027s justice, security and agriculture through poppy-replacement schemes.\nIn Kabul on Wednesday, Charles visited the Turquoise Mountain Foundation, of which he is co-patron with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.\nThe foundation aims to protect and regenerate traditional Afghan arts and crafts with woodwork, pottering and jewellery-making workshops as well as programs to rejuvenate Kabul\u0027s old city centre.\nCharles, 61, is the most senior member of the royal family to visit Afghanistan and the only one in living memory to visit Kabul.\nHe flew by Chinook helicopter Thursday over a patchwork of desert and poppy fields to Patrol Base Pimon, in Nad Ali, the central Helmand River valley, where 140 British soldiers are holding the frontline against an escalated Taliban threat.\nAFP\nJoin the conversation\n5 people are reading this now.\nComment on

It became a free paper in October.\nThe wealthy Russian oligarch, who has interests in banking and aviation, already co-owns with ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a 49-per cent holding in the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, which has been critical of the Kremlin.\nThe Independent was launched in 1986 by three journalists as a counterweight to other broadsheet titles owned by global media tycoons.\nIn 2003, it became the first British broadsheet to change to a tabloid format, a move later copied by rival The Times.\nBut its circulation has dwindled and it has been forced to shed jobs and re-locate its offices - moving into the same building as the Evening Standard in west London.\nThe Independent\u0027s average circulation last month was 183,547, down from 205,964 for the same month in 2009, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABCs). This is the lowest of Britain\u0027s five daily broadsheets.\nThe Independent on Sunday\u0027s circulation last month was 155,661, down from 179,487 for the same month the previous year.\nFollowing the sale, staff on the two linked papers will become employees of IPL but continue to operate from their current offices in Kensington, central London.\nIn results out Wednesday, INM reported 2009 operating profits of 177.2 million euro, a slump of 39 per cent on the previous year. It completed a rights issue and restructuring in December.\nThe group publishes over 200 newspapers and magazines around the world including India\u0027s Dainik Jagran, the New Zealand Herald and the Irish Independent.\nO\u0027Reilly described the sale as a \"most satisfactory and positive outcome\".\n\"After our successful refinancing in late 2009, this transaction marks an important milestone in the repositioning of our group and will allow INM to focus solely on its market leading, cash generative assets in Ireland, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand,\" he said.\nAFP\nJoin the conversation\n7 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 215 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 111 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 241 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 105 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 189 people read this\nTop World articles\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting\nSex games: dung beetle pulls 1141 times its own body weight\nRevealed: Australia\u0027s very own little tyrannosaur\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in advance of robbery\nHope found in tragic case of girl lost in Holocaust\nMore World articles\nWorld Topics\nPlacesExpand (30502)\nAll Places (30502)\nUS (17895)\nFrance (3957)\nChina (3515)\nLondon (3325)\nAfghanistan (2680)\nNew York (2434)\nGermany (2332)\nJapan (2096)\nPakistan (2055)\nNew Zealand (1951)\nIndia (1866)\nIran (1734)\nItaly (1650)\nIraq (1599)\nBeijing (1557)\nParis (1522)\nSpain (1516)\nSouth Africa (1480)\nIsrael (1407)\nCanada (1196)\nIndonesia (1005)\nLos Angeles (957)\nIreland (930)\nUK (814)\nNorth Korea (789)\nKabul (684)\nTokyo (669)\nBerlin (661)\nBaghdad (611)\nRome (598)\nSingapore (572)\nThailand (547)\nPhilippines (530)\nJakarta (527)\nPyongyang (492)\nJerusalem (482)\nDelhi (420)\nAuckland (386)\nCuba (379)\nMalaysia (355)\nHamilton (324)\nWellington (309)\nBangkok (304)\nMumbai (296)\nJohannesburg (215)\nManila (209)\nPapua New Guinea (202)\nLahore (198)\nCape Town (153)\nTel Aviv (129)\nChristchurch (122)\nEast Timor (119)\nPalestine (110)\nPort Moresby (109)\nPretoria (91)\nWashington DC (67)\nHavana (66)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (18086)\nAll People (18086)\nBarack Obama (4248)\nHillary Clinton (1001)\nGordon Brown (902)\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad (685)\nNicolas Sarkozy (554)\nBenjamin Netanyahu (461)\nRobert Gates (362)\nHu Jintao (263)\nSilvio Berlusconi (260)\nJoe Biden (254)\nDavid Miliband (246)\nVladimir Putin (239)\nFelipe Calderon (116)\nNancy Pelosi (115)\nTimothy Geithner (109)\nTaro Aso (108)\nJacob Zuma (106)\nAlistair Darling (103)\nMitch McConnell (99)\nJohn Key (86)\nSarah Palin (86)\nHarry Reid (85)\nNelson Mandela (79)\nEric Holder (79)\nKing Abdullah (77)\nNouri al-Maliki (76)\nShimon Peres (76)\nMichael Bloomberg (71)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4420)\nAll Organisations (4420)\nUnited Nations (1802)\nFBI (409)\nWorld Health Organisation (408)\nRed Cross (371)\nCIA (343)\nAmnesty International (228)\nWorld Bank (211)\nIMF (199)\nGreenpeace (118)\nMossad (91)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nWorld News Video More video\nPriest \u0027molested\u0027 deaf boys\nThe Vatican has defended its decision not to defrock an American priest accused of molesting some 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin.\nPlay video\nIsrael fail to reach agreement\nPlay video\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nPlay video\nStudents outraged at Ann Coulter\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?  ...\nMore blogs Â« Prev | Next Â»\nComments\nLatest Comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers  ...\nMore comments Â« Prev | Next Â»\nLatest\nFeatured Products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nMore products Â« Prev | Next Â»\nNews\nLatest News\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nImagine being able to read over 10,000 pages in  ...\nMore news Â« Prev | Next Â»\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

The valuables were in glass display cases inside, in plain view.\n\"I keep the house run-down on purpose as a way to camouflage the high-value collection I keep inside,\" he was quoted as saying by the newspaper El Pais.\nHe estimated its value at $US300 million. Police said they can neither confirm nor dispute that amount because they have no experts to do appraisals.\nThe two detainees, identified only as young Romanians, apparently invited their own arrest.\nA day after the burglary, they called police to report an attempted theft at their home about 10km from the mansion.\nOfficers searching it found a camera with pictures of the treasures and a sock containing an antique coin from the burgled house. They found the rest of the loot in a bag hidden in a nearby ravine.\nThe two men had learned from someone else in Riudecols that there were valuables in the mansion. Their call to police stemmed from an apparent fight with people who came around seeking a share of the goodies, the police official said.\nRiudecols\u0027 mayor, Pere Solanellas, said the town is shocked.\n\"This has been surreal because almost no one knew about this treasure,\" he said.\nAP\nJoin the conversation\n8 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 139 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 91 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 81 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 103 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 103 people read this\nTop World articles\nSex games: dung beetle pulls 1141 times its own body weight\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting\nRevealed: Australia\u0027s very own little tyrannosaur\nHope found in tragic case of girl lost in Holocaust\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in advance of robbery\nMore World articles\nWorld Topics\nPlacesExpand (30502)\nAll Places (30502)\nUS (17895)\nFrance (3957)\nChina (3515)\nLondon (3325)\nAfghanistan (2680)\nNew York (2434)\nGermany (2332)\nJapan (2096)\nPakistan (2055)\nNew Zealand (1951)\nIndia (1866)\nIran (1734)\nItaly (1650)\nIraq (1599)\nBeijing (1557)\nParis (1522)\nSpain (1516)\nSouth Africa (1480)\nIsrael (1407)\nCanada (1196)\nIndonesia (1005)\nLos Angeles (957)\nIreland (930)\nUK (814)\nNorth Korea (789)\nKabul (684)\nTokyo (669)\nBerlin (661)\nBaghdad (611)\nRome (598)\nSingapore (572)\nThailand (547)\nPhilippines (530)\nJakarta (527)\nPyongyang (492)\nJerusalem (482)\nDelhi (420)\nAuckland (386)\nCuba (379)\nMalaysia (355)\nHamilton (324)\nWellington (309)\nBangkok (304)\nMumbai (296)\nJohannesburg (215)\nManila (209)\nPapua New Guinea (202)\nLahore (198)\nCape Town (153)\nTel Aviv (129)\nChristchurch (122)\nEast Timor (119)\nPalestine (110)\nPort Moresby (109)\nPretoria (91)\nWashington DC (67)\nHavana (66)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (18086)\nAll People (18086)\nBarack Obama (4248)\nHillary Clinton (1001)\nGordon Brown (902)\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad (685)\nNicolas Sarkozy (554)\nBenjamin Netanyahu (461)\nRobert Gates (362)\nHu Jintao (263)\nSilvio Berlusconi (260)\nJoe Biden (254)\nDavid Miliband (246)\nVladimir Putin (239)\nFelipe Calderon (116)\nNancy Pelosi (115)\nTimothy Geithner (109)\nTaro Aso (108)\nJacob Zuma (106)\nAlistair Darling (103)\nMitch McConnell (99)\nJohn Key (86)\nSarah Palin (86)\nHarry Reid (85)\nNelson Mandela (79)\nEric Holder (79)\nKing Abdullah (77)\nNouri al-Maliki (76)\nShimon Peres (76)\nMichael Bloomberg (71)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4420)\nAll Organisations (4420)\nUnited Nations (1802)\nFBI (409)\nWorld Health Organisation (408)\nRed Cross (371)\nCIA (343)\nAmnesty International (228)\nWorld Bank (211)\nIMF (199)\nGreenpeace (118)\nMossad (91)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nWorld News Video More video\nPriest \u0027molested\u0027 deaf boys\nThe Vatican has defended its decision not to defrock an American priest accused of molesting some 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin.\nPlay video\nIsrael fail to reach agreement\nPlay video\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nPlay video\nStudents outraged at Ann Coulter\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?  ...\nMore blogs Â« Prev | Next Â»\nComments\nLatest Comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers  ...\nMore comments Â« Prev | Next Â»\nLatest\nFeatured Products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nMore products Â« Prev | Next Â»\nNews\nLatest News\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nImagine being able to read over 10,000 pages in  ...\nMore news Â« Prev | Next Â»\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

Photo: Reuters\nFrench first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy does not want Nicolas Sarkozy to run for re-election and wants to spend \"what time we have left in some peace\", according to an interview published Thursday.\nHer downbeat remarks appeared in Madame Figaro magazine on one of the worst weeks of her husband\u0027s presidency and at a time when some in his own party are beginning to ask whether he should stand again in 2012.\nSarkozy\u0027s right-wing allies took a drubbing from the left in this week\u0027s nationwide regional elections, opinion polls show him trailing his own prime minister in popularity and he has been forced to drop a planned carbon tax.\nIn the interview, Bruni repeated comments she made last year which, at the time, prompted Sarkozy to say he had yet to decide whether or not he would seek a second term in office.\n\"As a wife, I don\u0027t really want him to,\" the supermodel turned singer-songwriter said.\n\"Perhaps I am afraid he will let his health go. Perhaps I wish to live what time we have left in some peace?\" she added, promising, however, that she would \"go along quietly\" with whatever he decides.\nSarkozy is 55, and his wife 42, and questions were raised about the president\u0027s health in July last year after he collapsed while jogging in woods near his weekend residence west of Paris.\nDoctors described the attack as a harmless \"vasovagal episode\", a fainting fit caused by a twitch of the vasovagal nerve, usually during exertion.\nIn the interview, Bruni also lashed out at the news media over a spate of rumours about her personal life that began as unsourced claims on the internet and found their way unchecked onto the pages of European newspapers.\n\"I despise so-called journalists who use blogs as a credible source,\" the former model-turned singer was quoted as saying by Madame Figaro magazine, referring to the online rumours that were picked up by the newspapers.\n\"I despise rumours that come from an internet blog signed \u0027Mickey\u0027 or \u0027Superman\u0027,\" she added, in an interview with the magazine, a supplement of the pro-government newspaper Le Figaro.\n\"Rumours are part of human nature, even if they are degrading,\" she said, alleging that the media \"mistreat\" Sarkozy and it \"makes me angry\".\nAFP\nJoin the conversation\n23 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 126 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 52 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 139 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 75 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 103 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nClick to play video\nVideo\nSarkozy dealt electoral blow\nTop World articles\nSex games: dung beetle pulls 1141 times its own body weight\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting\nRevealed: Australia\u0027s very own little tyrannosaur\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in advance of robbery\nHope found in tragic case of girl lost in Holocaust\nMore World articles\nWorld Topics\nPlacesExpand (30502)\nAll Places (30502)\nUS (17895)\nFrance (3957)\nChina (3515)\nLondon (3325)\nAfghanistan (2680)\nNew York (2434)\nGermany (2332)\nJapan (2096)\nPakistan (2055)\nNew Zealand (1951)\nIndia (1866)\nIran (1734)\nItaly (1650)\nIraq (1599)\nBeijing (1557)\nParis (1522)\nSpain (1516)\nSouth Africa (1480)\nIsrael (1407)\nCanada (1196)\nIndonesia (1005)\nLos Angeles (957)\nIreland (930)\nUK (814)\nNorth Korea (789)\nKabul (684)\nTokyo (669)\nBerlin (661)\nBaghdad (611)\nRome (598)\nSingapore (572)\nThailand (547)\nPhilippines (530)\nJakarta (527)\nPyongyang (492)\nJerusalem (482)\nDelhi (420)\nAuckland (386)\nCuba (379)\nMalaysia (355)\nHamilton (324)\nWellington (309)\nBangkok (304)\nMumbai (296)\nJohannesburg (215)\nManila (209)\nPapua New Guinea (202)\nLahore (198)\nCape Town (153)\nTel Aviv (129)\nChristchurch (122)\nEast Timor (119)\nPalestine (110)\nPort Moresby (109)\nPretoria (91)\nWashington DC (67)\nHavana (66)\nMore Places\nPeopleExpand (18086)\nAll People (18086)\nBarack Obama (4248)\nHillary Clinton (1001)\nGordon Brown (902)\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad (685)\nNicolas Sarkozy (554)\nBenjamin Netanyahu (461)\nRobert Gates (362)\nHu Jintao (263)\nSilvio Berlusconi (260)\nJoe Biden (254)\nDavid Miliband (246)\nVladimir Putin (239)\nFelipe Calderon (116)\nNancy Pelosi (115)\nTimothy Geithner (109)\nTaro Aso (108)\nJacob Zuma (106)\nAlistair Darling (103)\nMitch McConnell (99)\nJohn Key (86)\nSarah Palin (86)\nHarry Reid (85)\nNelson Mandela (79)\nEric Holder (79)\nKing Abdullah (77)\nNouri al-Maliki (76)\nShimon Peres (76)\nMichael Bloomberg (71)\nMore People\nOrganisationsExpand (4420)\nAll Organisations (4420)\nUnited Nations (1802)\nFBI (409)\nWorld Health Organisation (408)\nRed Cross (371)\nCIA (343)\nAmnesty International (228)\nWorld Bank (211)\nIMF (199)\nGreenpeace (118)\nMossad (91)\nMore Organisations\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nClick to play video\nVideo\nSarkozy dealt electoral blow\nNicolas Sarkozy\u0027s centre-right UMP party is comprehensively beaten in France\u0027s regional elections.\nLatest Video\nWorld News Video More video\nPriest \u0027molested\u0027 deaf boys\nThe Vatican has defended its decision not to defrock an American priest accused of molesting some 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin.\nPlay video\nIsrael fail to reach agreement\nPlay video\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nPlay video\nStudents outraged at Ann Coulter\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?

He was also ordered to seek immediate psychiatric help.  As he began to cry, Justice Fullerton snapped at him to \u0027\u0027get a grip\u0027\u0027.\nMr Corben was charged in October with aggravated sexual assault and the deprivation of liberty of a woman, 34,  at the Ivy nightclub  that month. In December  he was   charged with several offences after allegedly detaining a   woman, 25, and sexually assaulting her in the Piano Room toilets in October 2008.\nJustice Fullerton said the offences had been \u0027\u0027strikingly similar\u0027\u0027 and she believed the Crown had a strong case.\nThe court heard that in April 2008 Mr Corben was charged with making sexually explicit suggestions over the phone. The offence was found proven but no conviction was recorded.\nThe court also heard that two other women had provided statements to police alleging Mr Corben had sexually assaulted them in 2006 and 2008. However, those matters had not proceeded to court.\nJoin the conversation\n25 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 105 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 93 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 151 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 82 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 79 people read this\nTop NSW articles\nMan dies after falling down Sydney sex club stairs\nIvy nightclub rape case accused a \u0027serial sexual predator\u0027, court told\nKeneally\u0027s state plan leaked on the web\nGirl, 15, first to be charged under police chase law\nSkye\u0027s law: second teenager charged\nMore NSW articles\nNSW Topics\nPlacesExpand (479)\nAll Places (479)\nSydney (343)\nParramatta (35)\nWestmead (24)\nLiverpool (24)\nNewcastle (23)\nBarangaroo (18)\nBondi (16)\nLeichhardt (15)\nGlebe (13)\nWaverley (13)\nDarling Harbour (13)\nWollongong (12)\nBankstown (12)\nCentral Coast (12)\nMerrylands (11)\nMaroubra (11)\nTown Hall (11)\nEpping (11)\nConcord (11)\nSurry Hills (11)\nRozelle (11)\nBurwood (10)\nFairfield (10)\nBalmain (10)\nKings Cross (10)\nNewtown (9)\nIllawarra (9)\nPenrith (9)\nCircular Quay (9)\nCoogee (8)\nGosford (8)\nRandwick (8)\nRedfern (8)\nElizabeth Bay (8)\nBellevue Hill (8)\nWoollahra (8)\nGuildford (7)\nDarlinghurst (7)\nMount Druitt (7)\nDulwich Hill (7)\nPaddington (7)\nStrathfield (7)\nMosman (7)\nGoulburn (7)\nBathurst (7)\nPort Macquarie (7)\nBondi Beach (6)\nNelson (6)\nDarling Point (6)\nManly (6)\nRouse Hill (6)\nLakemba (6)\nLismore (6)\nBotany (6)\nAnnandale (5)\nLane Cove (5)\nEveleigh (5)\nCanada Bay (5)\nMarrickville (5)\nBlacktown (5)\nPyrmont (5)\nCastlereagh (5)\nLake Macquarie (5)\nSt Leonards (5)\nCronulla (5)\nGordon (5)\nNowra (5)\nBlue Mountains (5)\nCampbelltown (5)\nRose Bay (5)\nGranville (4)\nChatswood (4)\nLilyfield (4)\nThe Rocks (4)\nLeppington (4)\nCanterbury (4)\nRichmond (4)\nDubbo (4)\nRyde (4)\nWatsons Bay (4)\nRosebery (4)\nCroydon (4)\nCamperdown (4)\nWindsor (4)\nHaymarket (3)\nRiverstone (3)\nBreakfast Point (3)\nLa Perouse (3)\nHornsby (3)\nQueanbeyan (3)\nTaree (3)\nWagga Wagga (3)\nSt Marys (3)\nHeathcote (3)\nTurramurra (3)\nRiverina (3)\nHomebush (3)\nMore Places\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nBreaking News Video More video\nDennis Hopper near death\nDennis Hopper\u0027s divorce attorney says that the actor is dying and can\u0027t undergo chemotherapy as he battles prostate cancer.\nPlay video\nIsrael fail to reach agreement\nPlay video\nMexican police turn to voodoo\nPlay video\nThieves phone-ahead robbery\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?  ...\nMore blogs Â« Prev | Next Â»\nComments\nLatest Comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers  ...\nMore comments Â« Prev | Next Â»\nLatest\nFeatured Products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nMore products Â« Prev | Next Â»\nNews\nLatest News\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nImagine being able to read over 10,000 pages in  ...\nMore news Â« Prev | Next Â»\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

It ended a short time later after the rider mounted a gutter, rode onto a footbridge and plunged into a nearby reserve.\nPolice say they found the bike in Canterbury after it was dumped by the rider.\nThe man is alleged to have then jumped into four backyards and broken into a home to avoid capture.\nHe was eventually found hiding in the grounds of a nearby church.\nThe man was arrested and charged under Skye\u0027s law, named after toddler Skye Sassine, killed in a police pursuit on New Year\u0027s Eve.\nA 15-year-old girl yesterday was the first person charged under the new laws.\nSkye\u0027s law carries jail terms of up to three years for a first offence and five years for repeat offenders.\nThe 19-year-old  man was also charged with drive while disqualified, riding unregistered motorcycle, four counts of trespass as well as an outstanding warrant.\nHe was refused bail and will appear in Burwood Local Court today.\nJoin the conversation\n40 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 246 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 140 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 181 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 148 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 123 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nGirl, 15, first to be charged under police chase law\n4:14pm\nA 15-year-old girl has become the first person charged in NSW under new ...\nTop NSW articles\nMan dies after falling down Sydney sex club stairs\nIvy nightclub rape case accused a \u0027serial sexual predator\u0027, court told\nKeneally\u0027s state plan leaked on the web\nGirl, 15, first to be charged under police chase law\nSkye\u0027s law: second teenager charged\nMore NSW articles\nNSW Topics\nPlacesExpand (479)\nAll Places (479)\nSydney (343)\nParramatta (35)\nWestmead (24)\nLiverpool (24)\nNewcastle (23)\nBarangaroo (18)\nBondi (16)\nLeichhardt (15)\nGlebe (13)\nWaverley (13)\nDarling Harbour (13)\nWollongong (12)\nBankstown (12)\nCentral Coast (12)\nMerrylands (11)\nMaroubra (11)\nTown Hall (11)\nEpping (11)\nConcord (11)\nSurry Hills (11)\nRozelle (11)\nBurwood (10)\nFairfield (10)\nBalmain (10)\nKings Cross (10)\nNewtown (9)\nIllawarra (9)\nPenrith (9)\nCircular Quay (9)\nCoogee (8)\nGosford (8)\nRandwick (8)\nRedfern (8)\nElizabeth Bay (8)\nBellevue Hill (8)\nWoollahra (8)\nGuildford (7)\nDarlinghurst (7)\nMount Druitt (7)\nDulwich Hill (7)\nPaddington (7)\nStrathfield (7)\nMosman (7)\nGoulburn (7)\nBathurst (7)\nPort Macquarie (7)\nBondi Beach (6)\nNelson (6)\nDarling Point (6)\nManly (6)\nRouse Hill (6)\nLakemba (6)\nLismore (6)\nBotany (6)\nAnnandale (5)\nLane Cove (5)\nEveleigh (5)\nCanada Bay (5)\nMarrickville (5)\nBlacktown (5)\nPyrmont (5)\nCastlereagh (5)\nLake Macquarie (5)\nSt Leonards (5)\nCronulla (5)\nGordon (5)\nNowra (5)\nBlue Mountains (5)\nCampbelltown (5)\nRose Bay (5)\nGranville (4)\nChatswood (4)\nLilyfield (4)\nThe Rocks (4)\nLeppington (4)\nCanterbury (4)\nRichmond (4)\nDubbo (4)\nRyde (4)\nWatsons Bay (4)\nRosebery (4)\nCroydon (4)\nCamperdown (4)\nWindsor (4)\nHaymarket (3)\nRiverstone (3)\nBreakfast Point (3)\nLa Perouse (3)\nHornsby (3)\nQueanbeyan (3)\nTaree (3)\nWagga Wagga (3)\nSt Marys (3)\nHeathcote (3)\nTurramurra (3)\nRiverina (3)\nHomebush (3)\nMore Places\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nGirl, 15, first to be charged under police chase law\n4:14pm\nA 15-year-old girl has become the first person charged in NSW under new police pursuit laws after allegedly leading officers on a 30-minute chase in the state\u0027s central west.\nLatest Video\nBreaking News Video More video\nDennis Hopper near death\nDennis Hopper\u0027s divorce attorney says that the actor is dying and can\u0027t undergo chemotherapy as he battles prostate cancer.\nPlay video\nIsrael fail to reach agreement\nPlay video\nMexican police turn to voodoo\nPlay video\nEddie regrets gay remarks\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?

Photo: Ben Rushton\nBARRY O\u0027FARRELL will cut payroll tax for businesses that provide the first 100,000 new jobs under his government, and says he can rely on \u0027\u0027driving opportunity for economic growth\u0027\u0027 to fund  infrastructure, rather than raising taxes or cutting services.\nBusinesses   hiring  the first 100,000 new employees after the election of an O\u0027Farrell government would receive a  rebate of $4000 for every full-time worker, to be paid on the first and second anniversary of their hiring.\nThe $4000 rebate would be enough to wipe an employer\u0027s annual payroll tax bill entirely for an employee, if they were paid the average wage.\nIn an interview with the Herald one year  from the state election, the Opposition Leader said the state had lost its mojo. He  did not rule out selling  the state\u0027s electricity generators to pay for new infrastructure.\nBut he said  the sale would  depend on three factors -  \u0027\u0027[ensuring] that value was protected, concerns about the capital markets and concern about the future of the price under  [an emissions trading scheme]\u0027\u0027.\nMr O\u0027Farrell blocked the sale of the electricity generators in 2008,  a move that helped  end the career of the then  premier Morris Iemma.\nHe  promised to release an electricity assets plan before the  election, after uncertainty over an emissions trading scheme is resolved.\nMr O\u0027Farrell said he would not mind if he failed to win control of the upper house,  arguing he believed in \u0027\u0027competition\u0027\u0027. He said the former prime minister John Howard\u0027s  taking control of the Senate  - which resulted in Work Choices laws passing - was the worst thing that  happened to his government.\n\u0027\u0027I can certainly make a very plausible case that having an upper house that you don\u0027t control, having to rely upon independents and others, can in some instances be helpful,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nMr O\u0027Farrell indicated his government would lean to the left on some issues. He said he did not intend to slash public service jobs and he believed strongly in public education.\nHe also said he would prefer a gas- or renewables-fired power station to a new coal-fired plant.\nThere would be no law-and-order auction before the election, Mr O\u0027Farrell promised.  \u0027\u0027Let\u0027s make the existing system work,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nHe said that unlike the last time the Coalition was elected to government in 1988, there was no plan to shut  schools.\nAsked if he could rule this out,  Mr O\u0027Farrell said: \u0027\u0027The answer is yes, but I don\u0027t think any government can ever give a categoric [yes] â€¦ . because the fact is there are demographic changes that occur across this city.\u0027\u0027\nMr O\u0027Farrell said he could not rule out cutting public service jobs because he had committed  to ending Labor\u0027s policy of \u0027\u0027no forced redundancies\u0027\u0027 but \u0027\u0027my approach â€¦  is to grow jobs, not reduce jobs\u0027\u0027.\nWhen asked if he had a  charisma problem given the high profile of the Premier, Kristina Keneally, Mr O\u0027Farrell said: \u0027\u0027I always thought charisma was a Greek word for sex appeal  â€¦  I think the people of NSW understand they don\u0027t need a showperson as minister, they need people who can actually do the job.\n\u0027\u0027Our vision of NSW is a vision that sees itself as No. 1 again.\n\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve lost our mojo, we\u0027ve lost the confidence in ourselves that saw us, amidst the 1991 recession, seek to hold an Olympic Games â€¦  that\u0027s what we\u0027ve got to get back to.\u0027\u0027\nJoin the conversation\n15 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also

Clover Moore, is under mounting pressure to resign her position on the Barangaroo Delivery Authority board after she backed a resolution criticising its  plans for the  site.\nSeveral City of Sydney councillors say Cr Moore\u0027s position on the  board has become untenable after the City of Sydney unanimously carried a resolution criticising its preferred proposal for the site as \u0027\u0027an overdevelopment\u0027\u0027 and calling plans for a new public pier and hotel  \u0027\u0027an unacceptable intrusion into Sydney Harbour\u0027\u0027.\nWhile public calls for her immediate resignation have come from her political opponents, two members of her team  have also acknowledged the difficult position in which Cr Moore finds herself.\n\u0027\u0027I imagine the lord mayor will be considering her position on the Barangaroo Delivery Authority following the council resolution,\u0027\u0027 said Cr John McInerney, an architect and former manager of planning for the City who is strongly opposed to the authority\u0027s plan.\nAnother member of Cr Moore\u0027s team, Marcelle Hoff, said that while she believed the lord mayor had the city\u0027s best interests at heart, some people would find it hard to reconcile the positions she has taken on the council and with the authority.\n\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t believe she\u0027s personally conflicted, but I appreciate that people see there\u0027s a conflict.\u0027\u0027\nCr Moore said  she will stay on the board, despite calls by the Greens councillors Chris Harris and Irene Doutney to resign now because of the conflict of interest with her dual roles restricting the council\u0027s ability to campaign against the development.\n\u0027\u0027I think it\u0027s time for us to be all together on how we approach this,\u0027\u0027 Cr Doutney said. \u0027\u0027How can we work to make sure the building heights are appropriate and the floor plates are appropriate, and that public land isn\u0027t disappearing into Lend Lease\u0027s pockets, when she is on the board?\u0027\u0027\nA Liberal councillor, Shayne Mallard, who drafted the motion against the preferred development, also called for Cr Moore to resign unless greater transparency could be achieved.\n\u0027\u0027I think the lord mayor is compromised by being on the board and not being able to report to council,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nCr Moore headed off calls for her resignation at last week\u0027s dramatic meeting when she surprised opposition councillors by supporting the motion and then amending it.\nCr Moore said she had always opposed the NSW government\u0027s decision to remove planning control for the Barangaroo site from the city and had only joined the  board to try and improve the development on  the site.\nBrushing aside the resignation calls, she promised to stay on the board \u0027\u0027as long as I believe I am adding value and there\u0027s as much benefit to the city as possible\u0027\u0027.\nThe chairman of the authority board, Michael Collins, backed her decision and said the authority and the council were different from normal commercial boards and there was no problem with the lord mayor adopting differing positions in the different organisations.\nIan Campbell, the head of the Barangaroo Action Group, which opposes the current development, said it was clear from the growing opposition Cr Moore would have to leave the  board.\n\u0027\u0027I can\u0027t see how Clover\u0027s position can be sustainable because she\u0027s on both sides of the fence,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nJoin the

He said most wood product burnt was sawdust and chips from the timber industry.\nHe dismissed rumours that medical waste from the Hunter New England Area Health Service was also burnt at Liddell.\nMacquarie Generation is licensed to burn the material by another state government authority, the Department of Climate Change Energy and Water. This department requires  polluters to test the material they intend to burn, monitor their  emissions, then provide the records to the department, which audits them.\nA spokeswoman for the Energy Minister, John Robertson, said there was no conflict of interest in the government burning waste at Liddell for profit, selling the power generated and having the polluters test and monitor emissions for oversight by the government.\nThe department\u0027s spokesman said test burns of the materials had been conducted and had established that the burns did not increase the concentration of heavy metals and other pollutants from the power station.\nResident action groups from the upper Hunter have begun challenging the amount of heavy industry surrounding them. Most NSW coal and energy is produced in the region. The government has  approved a third power plant for Lake Liddell.\nThough the government has plans to monitor the region\u0027s air for dangerous small particles, no network is in place and it has not  decided upon an agency to run the scheme.\nJohn Drinan, an environmental scientist and member of the Singleton Shire Healthy Environment Group, said he was not opposed to so-called co-firing, but the government was not transparent with residents about the program and had dismissed or ignored calls for health air quality studies in the area.\nGreg Smith, the chief executive of the  Asthma Foundation  NSW, said that wood burning was a source of fine particle pollution and the government had a poor record of monitoring fine particles, known as PM2.5.\n\u0027\u0027Though the government has the technology to monitor PM2.5, it doesn\u0027t do it because there is no national requirement to do so, but we know these are dangerous particles,\u0027\u0027 he said.\nDo you know more? investigations@smh.com.au\nJoin the conversation\nYou\u0027re the only person reading this now.

Photo: Ben Rushton\n\u0027\u0027IT WAS hard to imagine a worse example of a determined effort to kill a man for no real reason\u0027\u0027, a judge once said of the horrific attack on Wayne Smith, a prison guard, by an angry inmate.\nThe inmate, whose assault left Mr Smith with severe brain damage and head injuries, has long pleaded guilty.\nLast week, more than three years after the attack and Mr Smith\u0027s subsequent death - prison authorities finally took some responsibility for allowing it to happen, acknowledging they failed to provide a safe workplace for the experienced prison officer. But his family is still waiting for an explanation and an apology.\nHis son Nigel says they have been left in the dark. No-one has explained to him, his mother or brother how the inmate,  Carl Edward Little, a convicted armed robber, came to be at Silverwater, the minimum security jail where the attack occurred.\nLittle, who had a  history of violence and drug use, had been reclassified from a maximum to a minimum security prison in one step - something so extreme it now requires the signature of the commissioner or a deputy.\nA prison officer has been disciplined over her role in the reclassification, but the family has not been given any details.\nOnce at Silverwater, Little was allegedly standing over and assaulting other inmates, and authorities decided to return him to a medium security prison.\nIt was Mr Smith\u0027s job to tell him of the decision. Straight afterwards, when the escorts which were to return him to his cell failed to show up, Little snapped, king-hit Mr Smith, before punching and kicking the unconscious officer and repeatedly stomping on his head.\nGuards at Silverwater do not have firearms, batons or capsicum spray.\nMr Smith, a fit 57 year old who had to be revived on the way to hospital, was unrecognisable, so swollen was his face. He clung to life for six weeks before dying in January 2007. While his neurosurgeon believed it was the 80 per cent brain injury that killed him, the post mortem said his death \u0027\u0027may\u0027\u0027 have been related to a pre-existing heart condition.\nThe family insists he had no heart problems.\nThe Department of Corrective Services pleaded guilty before the Industrial Relations Commission to breaches of occupational health and safety laws, exposing officers to injury, and failing to handcuff Little and to provide two escorts.\nThe Public Service Association,  which represents prison officers, had instigated the private prosecution after WorkCover had decided not to act; but by then, time to prosecute over Little\u0027s reclassification had run out.\n\u0027\u0027WorkCover should explain to the family how it is they saw nothing wrong and the department has now turned around and pleaded guilty,\u0027\u0027 said the union\u0027s senior industrial officer, Stewart Little. But Nigel Smith blames the union for failing to prevent the delay.\nIn a plea bargain the Public  Service Association last week withdrew charges the department had also breached its obligations when reclassifying Little as a minimum security inmate, failing to segregate him, failing to have a rapid response team available and to have security cameras at the centre.\nMr Little says that Mr Smith\u0027s death is a reminder of the dangerous job that prison officers do, and that lessons have been learnt. There have been changes to reclassifications and segregations, and restraint of dangerous inmates, and the setting up of armed immediate response teams.\nWhen the case returns to court for sentencing this month, the question of whether the department\u0027s failures - or a mysterious heart condition - caused Mr Smith\u0027s death will be examined further.\nThe department\u0027s plea, while welcomed by the union, caused dismay to Nigel Smith. He just wanted the witnesses to explain what happened.\nAlready the convict\u0027s plea - to a charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, after charges of attempted murder were dropped - has deprived the family of finding out the truth.\n\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t feel justice has been done,\u0027\u0027  Mr Smith said. He said he felt angry and betrayed by the union, the department  and the criminal justice system.  \u0027\u0027Had there been a trial there would have been a lot more things revealed.\u0027\u0027\nAnd their wait for closure continues as Little is plan  to appeal against his minimum 15 year sentence. An inquest into Mr Smith\u0027s death is  still to be held.\ngjacobsen@smh.com.au\nJoin the conversation\n24 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 155 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 108 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 106 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 82 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 93 people read this\nTop NSW articles\nMan dies after falling down Sydney sex club stairs\nIvy nightclub rape case accused a \u0027serial sexual predator\u0027, court told\nKeneally\u0027s state plan leaked on the web\nGirl, 15, first to be charged under police chase law\nSkye\u0027s law: second teenager charged\nMore NSW articles\nNSW Topics\nPlacesExpand (479)\nAll Places (479)\nSydney (343)\nParramatta (35)\nWestmead (24)\nLiverpool (24)\nNewcastle (23)\nBarangaroo (18)\nBondi (16)\nLeichhardt (15)\nGlebe (13)\nWaverley (13)\nDarling Harbour (13)\nWollongong (12)\nBankstown (12)\nCentral Coast (12)\nMerrylands (11)\nMaroubra (11)\nTown Hall (11)\nEpping (11)\nConcord (11)\nSurry Hills (11)\nRozelle (11)\nBurwood (10)\nFairfield (10)\nBalmain (10)\nKings Cross (10)\nNewtown (9)\nIllawarra (9)\nPenrith (9)\nCircular Quay (9)\nCoogee (8)\nGosford (8)\nRandwick (8)\nRedfern (8)\nElizabeth Bay (8)\nBellevue Hill (8)\nWoollahra (8)\nGuildford (7)\nDarlinghurst (7)\nMount Druitt (7)\nDulwich Hill (7)\nPaddington (7)\nStrathfield (7)\nMosman (7)\nGoulburn (7)\nBathurst (7)\nPort Macquarie (7)\nBondi Beach (6)\nNelson (6)\nDarling Point (6)\nManly (6)\nRouse Hill (6)\nLakemba (6)\nLismore (6)\nBotany (6)\nAnnandale (5)\nLane Cove (5)\nEveleigh (5)\nCanada Bay (5)\nMarrickville (5)\nBlacktown (5)\nPyrmont (5)\nCastlereagh (5)\nLake Macquarie (5)\nSt Leonards (5)\nCronulla (5)\nGordon (5)\nNowra (5)\nBlue Mountains (5)\nCampbelltown (5)\nRose Bay (5)\nGranville (4)\nChatswood (4)\nLilyfield (4)\nThe Rocks (4)\nLeppington (4)\nCanterbury (4)\nRichmond (4)\nDubbo (4)\nRyde (4)\nWatsons Bay (4)\nRosebery (4)\nCroydon (4)\nCamperdown (4)\nWindsor (4)\nHaymarket (3)\nRiverstone (3)\nBreakfast Point (3)\nLa Perouse (3)\nHornsby (3)\nQueanbeyan (3)\nTaree (3)\nWagga Wagga (3)\nSt Marys (3)\nHeathcote (3)\nTurramurra (3)\nRiverina (3)\nHomebush (3)\nMore Places\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Video\nBreaking News Video More video\nDennis Hopper near death\nDennis Hopper\u0027s divorce attorney says that the actor is dying and can\u0027t undergo chemotherapy as he battles prostate cancer.\nPlay video\nIsrael fail to reach agreement\nPlay video\nMexican police turn to voodoo\nPlay video\nThieves phone ahead robbery\nBlogs\nLatest Blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nIf you\u0027ve digitised your music library, how do you access it?  ...\nMore blogs Â« Prev | Next Â»\nComments\nLatest Comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers  ...\nMore comments Â« Prev | Next Â»\nLatest\nFeatured Products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nMore products Â« Prev | Next Â»\nNews\nLatest News\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nImagine being able to read over 10,000 pages in  ...\nMore news Â« Prev | Next Â»\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

He also criticised Virgin America\u0027s apparent role in the show, pointing out much of the action was dedicated to the airline\u0027s publicity events.\nThe five flight attendants fall into to the regular reality TV show stereotypes, with the debut episode featuring the designated \u0027mean girl\u0027 of the group stealing her colleague\u0027s seat in order to get  next to Virgin boss Richard Branson.\nFollow Traveller on Twitter.\nSource: theage.com.au\nJoin the conversation\n83 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 198 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 186 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 121 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 119 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 135 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nRevealed: the do\u0027s and don\u0027ts of being an Air NZ hostie\n23 Mar\nNever say \"bun\", don\u0027t wear blue eyeshadow, pluck your monobrow, trim ...\nFlight test: Virgin America economy class\nThe pilot is \u0027totally psyched\u0027 but is this really America\u0027s best ...\nVirgin America apologises to passengers after 16-hour ordeal\n17 Mar\nVirgin America has offered refunds to US Dancing With the Stars judge ...\nFlight cancelled after flight attendants fight\n1 Mar\nAn argument between two female flight attendants forced the cancellation ...\nFlight attendants \u0027sell outfits to uniform fetish fans\u0027\n4 Mar\nFlight attendants for struggling Japan Airlines have been warned not to ...\nTop Travel articles\nWoman \u0027ogled\u0027: airport worker warned over body scanner use\nBritish Airways permanently axes perks for striking cabin crew\nFlight attendant reality show slammed for sexism\nIconic \u0027Hollywood\u0027 sign faces threat of destruction in three weeks\nLost luggage? 2009 had it in the bag\nMore Travel articles\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nRevealed: the do\u0027s and don\u0027ts of being an Air NZ hostie\n23 Mar\nNever say \"bun\", don\u0027t wear blue eyeshadow, pluck your monobrow, trim your nasal hair, stand up straight, use deodorant, and on no account put more than six teabags in the pot.\nFlight test: Virgin America economy class\nThe pilot is \u0027totally psyched\u0027 but is this really America\u0027s best domestic carrier?\nVirgin America apologises to passengers after 16-hour ordeal\n17 Mar\nVirgin America has offered refunds to US Dancing With the Stars judge Carrie Ann Inaba and other passengers who were stranded for hours on a grounded plane bound for New York from Los Angeles.\nFlight cancelled after flight attendants fight\n1 Mar\nAn argument between two female flight attendants forced the cancellation of an Atlanta-bound flight at an airport in upstate New York.\nFlight attendants \u0027sell outfits to uniform fetish fans\u0027\n4 Mar\nFlight attendants for struggling Japan Airlines have been warned not to sell their outfits online to uniform fetish fans.\nFind the perfect holiday\nPopular holiday ideas\nby activity\nFood and wine\nCruising\nDrives\nSurfing \u0026 Diving\nSkiing\nGreat outdoors\nby holiday type\nBudget\nLuxury\nBeach\nFamily\nBusiness\nWeekends away\nBest on Traveller\nParty kicks on at spring break despite violence\nPHOTOS\nStudents flock to Mexico\u0027s beach resorts despite warnings over drug-related violence.\nInside Airbus\u0027s Dreamliner rival\nPHOTOS\nThe planned Airbus A350 XWB (extra-wide body) is set to be an eco-friendly passenger aircraft to rival Boeing\u0027s Dreamliner.\nMore Traveller News\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

Photo: Reuters\nA conservation group warned yesterday they have just three weeks to raise $US3 million ($A3.29 million) to save the iconic \u0027Hollywood\u0027 sign from being razed by investors who want to build luxury houses on the site.\n\"We feel good about where we are and we feel good about our chances to do this,\" said Tim Ahern of the Trust for Public Land.\nThe group needs to raise three million dollars to reach the $US12.5 million needed to purchase the 138-acre (55-hectare) parcel of rugged land surrounding the sign from a Chicago-based consortium that has acquired rights to build four luxury mansions along the ridgeline.\nThe investors sought to sell the property for $US22 million but agreed to the $US12.5-million price tag for the conservation group only if payment arrives by April 14.\nLos Angeles council member Tom LaBonge said the trust has so far collected 9.5 million dollars -- four million from public funds, and the remainder 5.5 million dollars from private donors including movie and television companies and Hollywood stars such as director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks.\n\"We\u0027re getting closer to our goal and if we continue working hard, I know we\u0027ll reach it,\" said LaBonge.\nOne of the world\u0027s most recognizable landmarks, the sign was given a facelift last month when the trust shrouded each of the 13-metre high letters in blankets so the slogan \"SAVE THE PEAK\" became visible for miles around the sprawling Californian city.\nThe Hollywood sign itself, which was initially created as an advert for a real estate development called Hollywoodland in 1923, is owned by the city of Los Angeles.\nOne of the City of Angels\u0027 most beloved attractions, the sign had fallen into disrepair until it was restored in the 1970s after a campaign which saw nine donors pay 27,777 dollars to \"adopt\" one letter each.\nDonations for the trust\u0027s campaign can be made through the website www.savehollywoodland.org\nAFP\nJoin the conversation\n5 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 199 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 104 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 131 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 122 people read this\nCommon Business Main Index 240 people read this\nTop Travel articles\nWoman \u0027ogled\u0027: airport worker warned over body scanner use\nBritish Airways permanently axes perks for striking cabin crew\nFlight attendant reality show slammed for sexism\nIconic \u0027Hollywood\u0027 sign faces threat of destruction in three weeks\nLost luggage? 2009 had it in the bag\nMore Travel articles\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nFind the perfect holiday\nPopular holiday ideas\nby activity\nFood and wine\nCruising\nDrives\nSurfing \u0026 Diving\nSkiing\nGreat outdoors\nby holiday type\nBudget\nLuxury\nBeach\nFamily\nBusiness\nWeekends away\nBest on Traveller\nParty kicks on at spring break despite violence\nPHOTOS\nStudents flock to Mexico\u0027s beach resorts despite warnings over drug-related violence.\nInside Airbus\u0027s Dreamliner rival\nPHOTOS\nThe planned Airbus A350 XWB (extra-wide body) is set to be an eco-friendly passenger aircraft to rival Boeing\u0027s Dreamliner.\nMore Traveller News\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

The rest went unclaimed or, in rare cases, were stolen.\nSome 52 per cent of mishandled bags go astray during transfers from one flight to another, and the rest for various reasons -- including airport problems and customs and security inspections -- to be loaded onto their original flight.\nReuters\nJoin the conversation\n5 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 166 people read this\nFlight attendant reality show slammed for ... 47 people read this\nBritish Airways permanently axes perks for ... 21 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 102 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 98 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nTen tips to prevent losing your luggage and your cool\nThey say you can tell a lot about a person by the way they handle losing ...\nLetters: Luggage lost and no contact  from AirAsia\nWe flew with AirAsia and when we arrived in Kuala Lumpur, we discovered ...\nLetters: Locks broken, luggage rummaged in transit\nI, too, had broken locks on checked luggage when flying Malaysia ...\nCase study: top tips on packing your bags\nFrom vacuum packing to cool-weather layering, the canny traveller\u0027s ...\nTop Travel articles\nWoman \u0027ogled\u0027: airport worker warned over body scanner use\nBritish Airways permanently axes perks for striking cabin crew\nFlight attendant reality show slammed for sexism\nIconic \u0027Hollywood\u0027 sign faces threat of destruction in three weeks\nLost luggage? 2009 had it in the bag\nMore Travel articles\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nTen tips to prevent losing your luggage and your cool\nThey say you can tell a lot about a person by the way they handle losing their luggage.\nLetters: Luggage lost and no contact  from AirAsia\nWe flew with AirAsia and when we arrived in Kuala Lumpur, we discovered my husband\u0027s suitcase was missing.\nLetters: Locks broken, luggage rummaged in transit\nI, too, had broken locks on checked luggage when flying Malaysia Airlines.\nCase study: top tips on packing your bags\nFrom vacuum packing to cool-weather layering, the canny traveller\u0027s luggage mantra is all about economy.\nFind the perfect holiday\nPopular holiday ideas\nby activity\nFood and wine\nCruising\nDrives\nSurfing \u0026 Diving\nSkiing\nGreat outdoors\nby holiday type\nBudget\nLuxury\nBeach\nFamily\nBusiness\nWeekends away\nBest on Traveller\nParty kicks on at spring break despite violence\nPHOTOS\nStudents flock to Mexico\u0027s beach resorts despite warnings over drug-related violence.\nInside Airbus\u0027s Dreamliner rival\nPHOTOS\nThe planned Airbus A350 XWB (extra-wide body) is set to be an eco-friendly passenger aircraft to rival Boeing\u0027s Dreamliner.\nMore Traveller News\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

Photo: AFP\nThousands of US students downed cheap cocktails and partied at Mexico\u0027s beach resorts this week as top US officials took part in talks in Mexico City on spiralling drug violence.\nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took top national security advisers to Mexico for talks on a three-year, $US1.3-billion ($A1.41 billion) plan to fight organized crime in Mexico, barely a week after three US consulate-linked killings in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, and a string of violent deaths, from Acapulco on the Pacific to the northern economic hub of Monterrey.\nThe United States and Canada have issued travel warnings that college students avoid border areas during this year\u0027s spring break, but students still flocked to Mexico\u0027s beach resorts, where the warnings do not apply.\n\"We thought about the violence before we came, but I feel safe now I\u0027m here,\" said 21-year-old student Keith, from the University of Colorado, who traveled to Cancun with a friend.\nSwimsuit-clad youths grasped plastic cups of beer as they danced throughout the day and night on the white sand beaches of the Caribbean resort and music blared out over the waves.\nTourism workers dismissed news reports on Mexico\u0027s gruesome violence, saying business was good, after beaches emptied out at around the same time last year due to both the economic crisis and the outbreak of A(H1N1) flu in Mexico.\n\"This year we\u0027ve started well. When there\u0027s tourism, there\u0027s work for everyone,\" said Mexican taxi driver Jose Rodriguez.\nThe number of foreign tourists visiting Mexico dropped by around 1.1 million, to 21.5 million, in 2008, and its tourist income sank to some $US11.3 billion, down $US2 billion from the previous year.\nBut tens of thousands of spring breakers, who travel south of the border from late February to early April, continue to be attracted to Mexico\u0027s warm climes, cheap packages and rumours of lax laws.\nCancun, Mexico\u0027s most popular resort for foreign visitors, last week recorded occupancy of more than 85 per cent in its more than 80,000 rooms, President Felipe Calderon said on Monday.\nAcross the country in Pacific areas around Acapulco, where some 50 people have died in suspected drug attacks in recent weeks, tourists numbers appeared steady for now, according to industry professionals.\nAcapulco\u0027s tourism promotion agency reported hotel occupancy at 93 per cent, as officials pushed an Internet campaign showing security operations to protect tourists.\nDrug violence has surged across Mexico since Calderon launched a military crackdown on organized crime when he took office at the end of 2006.\nMore than 15,000 people have died in suspected drug attacks since then, mainly in score-settling between gang members on trafficking routes, sparking fears north of the border that Mexico is practically at war.\n\"I wasn\u0027t afraid, but Niki and Alex, my friends, were afraid they\u0027d be robbed or kidnapped,\" said 21-year-old Gina, a biology student at the University of Illinois.\n\"But now they\u0027re happy. We\u0027re going out in bars and clubs at night and there\u0027s no problem.\"\nPhotos: Spring break parties on\nMany hotels welcome the notoriously rowdy crowds for their part in maintaining Mexico\u0027s role as one of the world\u0027s top tourist destinations.\n\"I love Cancun, yes definitively I will come back,\" said 26-year-old British doctor Mark, as he smoked a joint, which is illegal in Mexico, and partied with US students on the beach in Cancun.\nAFP\nFollow Traveller on Twitter.\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nFlight attendant reality show slammed for ... 62 people read this\nSpicy sauce to punish children 84 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 200 people read this\nMan dies after falling down Sydney sex club ... 14 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 83 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nClick for more photos\nPhotos\nParty kicks on at spring break despite violence\nCancun comeback for students\u0027 spring break\n11 Mar\nMexico\u0027s traditional spring break king, Cancun, is rebounding quickly ...\nTop Travel articles\nWoman \u0027ogled\u0027: airport worker warned over body scanner use\nBritish Airways permanently axes perks for striking cabin crew\nFlight attendant reality show slammed for sexism\nIconic \u0027Hollywood\u0027 sign faces threat of destruction in three weeks\nLost luggage? 2009 had it in the bag\nMore Travel articles\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nClick for more photos\nPhotos\nParty kicks on at spring break despite violence\nStudents flock to Mexico\u0027s beach resorts despite warnings over drug-related violence.\nCancun comeback for students\u0027 spring break\n11 Mar\nMexico\u0027s traditional spring break king, Cancun, is rebounding quickly from last year\u0027s triple blow to its tourism industry caused by the country\u0027s swine flu epidemic, drug violence and a global economic crisis.\nFind the perfect holiday\nPopular holiday ideas\nby activity\nFood and wine\nCruising\nDrives\nSurfing \u0026 Diving\nSkiing\nGreat outdoors\nby holiday type\nBudget\nLuxury\nBeach\nFamily\nBusiness\nWeekends away\nBest on Traveller\nParty kicks on at spring break despite violence\nPHOTOS\nStudents flock to Mexico\u0027s beach resorts despite warnings over drug-related violence.\nInside Airbus\u0027s Dreamliner rival\nPHOTOS\nThe planned Airbus A350 XWB (extra-wide body) is set to be an eco-friendly passenger aircraft to rival Boeing\u0027s Dreamliner.\nMore Traveller News\nMoney\nCompare \u0026 Save - Get rates well below the Big 4\nSmh.com.au\nCompare All Saving Accounts\nCompare All Home Loans\nCompare All Credit Cards\nEssential Baby\nEB members on Hey Dad!\nEssentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nHome Price Guide\nHow much should you pay?

Photo: AFP\nA security worker at London\u0027s Heathrow Airport has received a police warning and faces disciplinary action over claims he ogled a female colleague using a full-body scanner, officials said yesterday.\nThe 25-year-old worker made lewd comments after his colleague Jo Margetson, 29, mistakenly strayed into the scanner, which can see through clothes to produce an image of the body, the Sun newspaper reported.\nThe case is believed to be the first of its kind since the full-body scanners were rushed into service at a number of British airports in the wake of an attempt by a suspected Muslim extremist to blow up a plane bound for Detroit on December 25.\nThey are now being rolled out at airports across the world.\nDetails of the incident at Heathrow\u0027s Terminal 5 on March 10 emerged on the day lawmakers said concerns that the scanners were intrusive had been overblown.\nMargetson told the Sun she had been \"traumatized\" by what had happened and had informed police and her bosses at the airport\u0027s operator BAA.\n\"We treat any allegations of inappropriate behavior or misuse of security equipment very seriously and these claims are being investigated thoroughly,\" said a spokeswoman for BAA.\n\"If found to be substantiated, we will take appropriate action.\"\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers had been informed of the allegation and \"a first instance harassment warning has been issued to a 25-year-old man.\"\nOpponents of scanners have argued since their introduction that they risked breaching individuals\u0027 rights to privacy. Britain\u0027s Equality and Human Rights Commission has already said they might be breaking discrimination and privacy laws.\n\"For every official caught ogling like this, there are plenty more eyeing up law-abiding travelers,\" Alex Deane, director of the Big Brother Watch campaign group, told the Sun.\n\"These expensive machines are totally disproportionate.\"\nThe government says staff using the machines are properly supervised and would not be able to see the person being scanned.

Other comments also revealed areas of wastage within Corrective Services.\nPublic Service Association senior industrial officer Stewart Little argued that what people do in their own time should not be subject to misconduct allegations.\nHe said talking on Facebook was \"the same as people talking in the pub letting off steam\".\nIn a statement released today, Public Service Association general secretary John Cahill said the department had abandoned fairness and proper processes in its haste to make an example of the officers. He appealed to the department to give up its \"Facebook witch-hunt\".\n\"While the IRC has overruled the departmentâ€™s current disciplinary procedures, it has not addressed the legality of employers spying on their employees on Facebook and other social media sites,\" said Cahill.\n\"The actions of the Department of Corrections in this case have set a dangerous precedent.

However, Weichert said the issue is being discussed with other data protection officials in the 27-nation European Union, which in 2000 declared privacy a fundamental right that companies and governments must respect.\nThe European stance differs strongly from the self-regulatory, free market approach favourite in the United States, where Web companies have flourished by offering users free services if they provide personal information to help advertising target them better, according to Columbia University law professor Eben Moglen.\n\"If the European regulators get serious, it will create a significant conflict,\" said Moglen, who has been examining online privacy issues since the early days of the Web.\nRichard Allan, director of policy for Facebook Europe, said some of the functions being scrutinized â€” such as those allowing users to upload their friends\u0027 e-mail addresses to find them online â€” were common across the industry. The company has recently added a tool for nonusers to have their data removed, he said.\n\"As a global company what we\u0027re trying to do is to make sure that our systems meet the requirements of all the jurisdictions in which we operate,\" Allan said.\nAccording to Joe McNamee of the Brussels-based advocacy group European Digital Rights, one of the most common complaints about Facebook is its habit of getting users to \u0027invite\u0027 their e-mail contacts to become members too.\n\"The receiver didn\u0027t want the messages, and the sender didn\u0027t realise they were going out,\" said McNamee. \"You would have to search long and hard for someone who would see consent in there.\"\nEuropean Union privacy watchdogs showed their appetite for going after Google last month, when the 27-nation bloc told the search giant to warn people before it sends cameras into cities to take pictures for its Street View maps.\nGoogle\u0027s data privacy chief Peter Fleischer said he is also \"still reeling\" from the Italian court decision that sentenced him and two other senior officials to six-month suspended sentences for violating an autistic teenager\u0027s right to privacy by allowing a video of him being bullied to be posted on the Net.\nVetting all user-generated content would be costly because of the vast amount of data involved, said Fleischer. It could also come close to censorship, because companies would be forced to draw the line between legitimate free speech and invasion of privacy, he said. Blogger, YouTube and other Google products have long been used by activists from Iceland to Iran to document government and corporate abuses.\nBut Fleischer acknowledged that users themselves should be more thoughtful about what they post, especially if it involves private material about others.\n\"Both as a matter of common sense and as a matter of common courtesy, users should not upload photos or videos of other people unless those other people consented,\" he said.\nPrivacy concerns prompted the California-based company last year to hold off including face recognition when it launched Google Goggles, a tool to identify and provide information about objects inside pictures. Another company, Face.com, has gone ahead with its own face-recognition tool, though CEO Gil Hirsch says there are built-in restrictions to ensure privacy.\nWhile Facebook and Google say they are committed to working with European regulators, privacy campaigners say the companies move only as fast as absolutely necessary. Earlier this year Facebook agreed to raise the minimum age for users in Spain from 13 to 14, to conform with the country\u0027s privacy laws. It has no such age requirement for information users posts about others.\nMoglen, of Columbia University, said even if European regulators rallied together they would find it difficult to force their rules upon U.S. companies, given the close relationship between Silicon Valley and the administration of President Barack Obama.\n\"If the Europeans want that fight, then surely the American government wants the other side.\"\nAP\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 164 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 122 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 72 people read this\nMan who hacked Obama\u0027s Twitter released 6 people read this\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ... 87 people read this\nTop Technology articles\nFacebook Six prison officers beat bid to sack them\nConroy\u0027s net gag sparks assassination and bomb plot chatter\nRacist police emails \u0027disturbing and gross\u0027\nMan who hacked Obama\u0027s Twitter released\nPrivacy battle looms for Google and Facebook\nMore Technology articles\nTechnology Topics\nTopicsExpand (84)\nAll Topics (84)\nSpace (70)\nScience (35)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nBlogs\nLatest blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nShould they tax second-hand games?\nMarch 23rd\nMarch 21st\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution\nMore blogs\nComments\nLatest comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) Maximus III Gene Motherboard  ...\nWill Facebook be more bigger than Google?\nWinners of EeePC Seashell 1001HA\nMore forums\nLatest\nFeatured products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nEAH5850 DirectCU TOP/2DIS/1GD5\nUnrivalled visual quality and intense gaming performance with DX11\nMore products\nNews\nLatest news\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nLiving in the lap of luxury\nMarch 16th\nMarch 11th\nOut with the old, or in with repairs?\nMore news\nBlogs\nSplit Screen: Metro-textual\nAficionados of Japanese games often bemoan the Englishâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: Screen Play\nDate: Fri 26 Mar 2010\nComments  (8)\nAFL Dreamteam - World of Warcraftâ€¦\nNext time some sports buff gives you grief for playingâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: Gadgets on the Go\nDate: Thu 25 Mar 2010\nComments  (7)\nThe BT Breakfast Club - whereâ€¦\nbrisbanetimes.com.au bloggers are this week swapping rolesâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: The Geek\nDate: Thu 18 Mar 2010\nComments  (85)\nPrev\nNext\nCompare \u0026 Save\nPopular Phones \u0026 Plans\nPhones\nDeals\nBrands\n1) Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB\n36 plans\nÂ 8%\n2) Apple iPhone 3GS 32GB\n36 plans\nÂ 2%\n3) Apple iPhone 8GB\n43 plans\nÂ 3%\n4) Nokia N97\n40 plans\nÂ 1%\n5) HTC Magic\n5 plans\nÂ 2%\nThis Guy is Not\nBob.

He\u0027s not a genius,\" said the source.\n\"He was a young man spending time on the Internet. He acted as a result of a bet, out of the defiance of the hacker. He is the sort who likes to claim responsibility for what he has done,\" added prosecutor Jean-Yves Coquillat.\nHacking into a database is a crime in France which carries a maximum two-year prison sentence.\nSan Francisco-based Twitter did not immediately reply to an email from AFP about the arrest while the FBI said it was looking into the report.\nIn July, leading US technology blog TechCrunch.com reported that it had received a file containing 310 confidential corporate and personal documents from \"Hacker Croll\" about Twitter and Twitter employees,\nTechCrunch said the documents included executive meeting notes, partner agreements, financial projections, calendars, phone logs, office plans, and other information.\nTechCrunch published some of the documents and declined to publish others.\nTwitter founder Evan Williams acknowledged to TechCrunch at the time that documents had been obtained in the attack but insisted that the hacker did not gain access to any Twitter user accounts.\nThe hacker, who attacked the Twitter accounts of several US celebrities, had also attacked Facebook pages and email accounts operated by Google and other providers, the police said.\nBut he had never attempted to profit financially from his hacking activities on Twitter, in which users can send out messages of 140 characters or less, they added.\nHe had managed to secure Twitter\u0027s administrator codes and was able to create, modify or delete accounts at will, the source said, adding that the hacker set up a blog to share his discoveries.\nThe hacker had no particular technological expertise, said police, but simply guessed people\u0027s passwords by working them out from information on their blogs or online pages they had created about themselves, police said.\nHe would also do this by answering the \"secret question\" on web-based email accounts - which people often answer by giving their maiden name or the name of their pet - and then use this to gain access to Twitter passwords.\n\"Hacker Croll\" liked to post electronic copies of the pages he hacked into on French online forums to prove that he gained administrator access to Twitter accounts, according to online reports on his activities.\nThe French hacker was known to police for minor scams that had netted 15,000 euros (20,000 dollars), according to the police.\nThe FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) alerted French authorities to his presence on French territory in July last year.\nFour FBI agents worked with French police for several months to track down \"Hacker Croll\" and stop the attacks on Twitter, which has millions of users across the world.\nIn January last year, dozens of Twitter accounts, including that of pop star Britney Spears, were hacked into and fake messages sent out.\nHackers knocked the site offline for several hours last August.\nWhile an everyday chatting tool for many, Twitter has become a weapon used by dissidents to circumvent censorship in places where freedom of speech is suppressed.\nTwitter said last month that users were creating 50 million messages per day.\nThe San Francisco-based Twitter does not release figures on the total number of users of the service, which was launched in August 2006.\nAFP\nJoin the conversation\n5 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nTechnology 4 people read this\n$220m credit card theft: hacker jailed for ... 14 people read this\nFlight attendant reality show slammed for ... 66 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 221 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 92 people read this\nTop Technology articles\nFacebook Six prison officers beat bid to sack them\nConroy\u0027s net gag sparks assassination and bomb plot chatter\nRacist police emails \u0027disturbing and gross\u0027\nMan who hacked Obama\u0027s Twitter released\nPrivacy battle looms for Google and Facebook\nMore Technology articles\nTechnology Topics\nTopicsExpand (84)\nAll Topics (84)\nSpace (70)\nScience (35)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nBlogs\nLatest blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nShould they tax second-hand games?\nMarch 23rd\nMarch 21st\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution\nMore blogs\nComments\nLatest comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) Maximus III Gene Motherboard  ...\nWill Facebook be more bigger than Google?\nWinners of EeePC Seashell 1001HA\nMore forums\nLatest\nFeatured products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nEAH5850 DirectCU TOP/2DIS/1GD5\nUnrivalled visual quality and intense gaming performance with DX11\nMore products\nNews\nLatest news\nASUS unveils its first e-reader -

Communications Minister Stephen Conroy. Photo: Michele Mossop\nMembers of the community responsible for recent attacks on government websites are now discussing a violent uprising, trading bomb recipes and calling for the assassination of Communications Minister Stephen Conroy.\nSenator Conroy\u0027s appearance on the 7pm Project last night to defend his internet filtering policy has galvanised online miscreants who are planning new attacks.\nPosts on the anonymous 4chan messageboard, the same community thought to be responsible for bringing down government websites in February, reveal a serious escalation in their rhetoric.\nThe government plans to introduce legislation within weeks forcing ISPs to block a blacklist of \"refused classification\" websites for all Australians on a mandatory basis. In submissions to the government made public this week, Australia\u0027s biggest technology companies, communications academics and many lobby groups warned the filters would do little to protect children online and would stifle free speech.\n\"Our government is corrupt, they are taking advantage of they\u0027re [sic] power and won\u0027t even allow the public to view the blacklist under the idea that \u0027the list would highlight where to find illegal material\u0027... this is no longer just about the censor, this is about our government trying to force us and cage us into submission like in many other corrupt countries,\" one post read.\n\"It would be near impossible for us to take down the entire government, but we must in some way make it clear that they do not control our f---ing lives to this degree. We must do something.\"\nReferring to their February websites attacks, known as \" Operation Titstorm \", several members said that taking down websites was not enough to convince the government to back down on the internet filtering policy.\n\"I propose assassination or at least scare the f--- out of them,\" one poster wrote.\n\"I\u0027m going to stick Conroy in the throat. Who\u0027s with me?\" wrote another.\nAnother poster suggested taking some tips out of the notorious \"Anarchist Cookbook\" and starting to vandalise buildings, power boxes, telephone boxes and other targets.\n\"Telephone wires are safe to pull down with a rope, not powerlines. Make some f---ing thermite and melt through some government vehicles. Find a way to shut down a freeway. Be smart about this shit.\"\nSeveral others said violence and riots were not advisable and suggested launching attacks on a popular government website such as MySchool.edu.au.\nOpponents to the internet filter policy staged a peaceful nationwide anti-censorship protest outside government buildings last month but it was considered by the community to be a dismal failure, as few people showed up.\nOne poster on 4chan referred to the recent 2000-strong riot outside a Melbourne Bob Jane T-mart store, which quickly turned violent and caused $50,000 worth of damage. They noted how police stood by as people smashed windows with baseball bats, saying \"we need to do that\".\n\"What people need to do is start a violent riot of massive proportions, storm parliament house and kill f---ing everybody.\"\nAnother listed a detailed recipe, with step-by-step instructions, showing how to make a bomb out of acetone, hydrogren peroxide and hydrochloric acid. It was followed by instructions on how to destroy cars with thermite and how to make black powder bombs and napalm.\n\"Physical protests that threaten the running of the economy (ie cabbie style) seem to put those bitch politicians in their places,\" a poster wrote.\nOne suggested members to \"man up\" and go out the front of Parliament, \"preferably when crowded and be an hero as gruesomely as possible, a pipe bomb to the head or something\".\nColin Jacobs, spokesman for the online users\u0027 lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia, said he believed the violent talk was most likely \"just idiots mouthing off\" with no real intention or capacity to follow through with their threats.\n\"We certainly hope this is the case. In any case, it\u0027s a serious matter,\" he said.\n\"It would be a tragedy for Australia if anybody decided to try and decide political disagreements using any form of violence whatsoever. The only punishment we would wish on a government minister is on the pages of our newspapers or at the ballot box.\"Â \nThe Australian Federal Police refused to comment on whether it was monitoring 4chan or any measures it might take to track down the posters or safeguard against any attacks.\n\"The AFP works with appropriate government agencies to protect and mitigate the impact of potential crimes against Australian interests,\" it said in a statement.\nComment is being sought from Senator Conroy.\nComments\n58 comments\nAs much as I oppose Conroy\u0027s plans to censor the internet feed to Australia, I am also no fan of Anonymous or the losers at 4chan. They are a bunch of self important morons with rampaging ego\u0027s, and by giving any threats they make news coverage you are only serving to inflate their ego\u0027s even more.\nOld internet saying:\nPlease do not feed the trolls....\nMichael Hunt | Dubbo             - March 25, 2010, 3:07PM\nFor those not familiar with the 4chan vernacular, being \"an hero\" means to commit suicide. The person suggesting that they man up and \"be an hero as gruesomely as possible, a pipe bomb to the head or something\" was suggesting that they kill themselves.\nNot a channer | Somewhere nice, maybe Fiji. Ooh, Hawaii! Yes, that\u0027ll do.             - March 25, 2010, 3:05PM\nto hunt and channer why don\u0027t you look at the true problem here instead of going on a bout this little group. In today In an age as advanced as ours the Labour party is going to set the rule for what websites adults can go to. Mayby at first it wont be seem to severe but more and more will be done over the years and we will lose more freedoms. Eventually it could even get to the stage where negative political pages are blocked, who knows Labour will probably do it know. The law is simply the continuisation of our liberties being taken of us. And that really should bother all Australians, not some silly threats some hackers have made!\npaul - March 25, 2010, 3:25PM\nRole on chairman MAO\nAndrew - March 25, 2010, 3:25PM\nOh won\u0027t someone think of the children. Oh wait, these comments come from children.\nI remember as a kid having all sorts of wild, stupid and violent ideas to get back at teachers and other kids I thought had done me wrong. Of course we just talked about it after school in the park, not on the internet. Lucky us because the internet is serious business.\nPoopleDoop | Pergatory             - March 25, 2010, 3:25PM\nThe government are fools. What next, dealing with climate change by holding back the tide? \"Refused classification\" signifies that someone has looked at a website, assessed its content against classification criteria and decided that it does not meet it at all and therefore refused classification. With the pace of government this is going to take weeks at best by which time the same content will have already appeared in twenty other places. Morons, ooh look what we\u0027re doing to look after you, aren\u0027t we good, monkeys.\nDave | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 3:24PM\nFunny part about this is that the majority of people involved in this will turn out not to be Australian.\nI strongly oppose the filter, but acting like little punks is doing nothing for the cause. The /b/ kids need to realise the public will misunderstand their bravado and tough talk..and perceive them as violent terrorists as opposed to the disgruntled 15-16 year old kids they really are.\nAnonymous...your motives are good. Your methods are fail.\nHank - March 25, 2010, 3:24PM\nDon\u0027t worry about the internet. It won\u0027t get passed in the Senate and Conroy will be out after the election. He\u0027s political baggage and Rudd will dump him in a ministerial reshuffle.\neyeroll | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 3:23PM\nIt appears our government doesn\u0027t know what its doing. It wants to uncensor gamers by finally giving them an R18+ rating, yet wants to censor the rest of us with a mandatory filter.\nWhy doesn\u0027t the government put the money its wasting on this futile effort into the Federal police and State Police so they can effectively deal with the issue.\nThis filter will not stop the trade of child pornography. Deviants already hide and swap this material so deep in the internet, on ambiguous forums and sites that the filter wont even recognise they are offensive.\nThis is the worst form of censorship ever. some would say reminiscent of the Chinese mandatory filtering system.\nIt appears Rudd has taken more than the language from China\nBob | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 3:22PM\n4chan \u003d keyboard warriors\nIt\u0027s very easy for these guys to propose this kind of radical behaviour it\u0027s all anonymous.\nAlex - March 25, 2010, 3:21PM\nShow more comments\nComments are now closed\nJoin the conversation\n10 people are reading this now.\n58 comments .\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 200 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 222 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 175 people read this\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 114 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 158 people read this\nI\u0027m going to stick Conroy in the throat.

Sorry to send u a message like this but bin tryin to ring u but gettin no joy.\n\"I had to tell the owner bout u losin that tenner coz obviously the till was down at the end of day. she wasn\u0027t very pleased at all and despite me trying to persuade her otherwise she said I have to let u go. I\u0027m really sorry.\n\"If u call in in the week with your uniform i\u0027ll sort your wages out. Once again I\u0027m really sorry but it\u0027s out of my hands.

A web-based service created by an Australian launches this week to enable shoppers to vote on which companies treat their staff, customers, suppliers, investors and the environment the best.\nThought to be the first of its kind the service invites users to comment and rate a company based on up-to-the-minute information it publishes about the world\u0027s top 300 brands.\nBy aggregting the individual opinions of thousands of users \u0027the crowd\u0027 determines how good or bad a company is. High-scoring companies are likely to attract more custom from communities of concerned shoppers, while lower-scoring one will be encouraged to do better.\nBrandkarma founder Craig Davis said it adds \"another voice in the room\" to balance those of NGOs, corporations and governments in the debate around sustainability.\n\"The question around the choices that we make is becoming more significant. People exercise those choices - in effect their vote - every time they buy something,\" said Mr Davis, whose day job is chief creative officer at Sydney advertising agency Publicis Mojo.\nAfter more than 20 years of creating ads for global companies such as Nestle, Shell, Unilever and Ford, Mr Davis said he asked himself the question: \"What kind of world do you want to live in - and leave to your kids.\" The answer is a service that borrows social networking tools to create a Facebook of brands that claims its mission is to \"help people help each other make better brand choices and encourage companies to be good to all their stakeholders\".\nA brand\u0027s overall performance is easured by its appearance on the website â€“ red is bad while green is good â€“ and by its overall score that can allow comparisons to be made with competitors. He said he was not worried about companies that were receiving poor ratings rorting the system as they \"would eventually be found out\". He would make money out of selling the insights gleaned from the data back to companies to \"make better brands\" but would not divulge any personal information of users. Experts in the field of ethical or consumer activism welcomed the idea. Oliver Wagg, the managing editor of Ethical Investor magazine, said that Australian consumers who were interested in shopping sustainably had few places to turn to for information.\n\"An increasing number of directories and websites are emerging to help consumers make the right decision about \u0027green\u0027 products and services. But these sources generally point consumers to products and services that brand themselves as \u0027green\u0027, leaving them to carry out their own verification and of course open to false advertising, or \u0027greenwashing\u0027,\" he said.\nAlthough Brandkarma is thought to be the first service of its kind in the world, consumer activism in generally has already taken root.\nA US-based service called Carrotmob is gaining traction with its co-ordinated grassroots efforts that leverage consumer power.\nIn October its Australian debut attracted 200 people who shopped exclusively at a Surry Hills supermarket that had pledged 20 per cent of its sales to go towards the \"greening\" of the store. More such events are planned.\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nNews Wire 17 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 222 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 203 people read this\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two ... 99 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 118 people read this\nTop Technology articles\nFacebook Six prison officers beat bid to sack them\nConroy\u0027s net gag sparks assassination and bomb plot chatter\nRacist police emails \u0027disturbing and gross\u0027\nMan who hacked Obama\u0027s Twitter released\nPrivacy battle looms for Google and Facebook\nMore Technology articles\nTechnology Topics\nTopicsExpand (84)\nAll Topics (84)\nSpace (70)\nScience (35)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nBlogs\nLatest blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nShould they tax second-hand games?\nMarch 23rd\nMarch 21st\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution\nMore blogs\nComments\nLatest comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) Maximus III Gene Motherboard  ...\nWill Facebook be more bigger than Google?\nWinners of EeePC Seashell 1001HA\nMore forums\nLatest\nFeatured products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nEAH5850 DirectCU TOP/2DIS/1GD5\nUnrivalled visual quality and intense gaming performance with DX11\nMore products\nNews\nLatest news\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nLiving in the lap of luxury\nMarch 16th\nMarch 11th\nOut with the old, or in with repairs?\nMore news\nBlogs\nSplit Screen: Metro-textual\nAficionados of Japanese games often bemoan the Englishâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: Screen Play\nDate: Fri 26 Mar 2010\nComments  (8)\nAFL Dreamteam - World of Warcraftâ€¦\nNext time some sports buff gives you grief for playingâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: Gadgets on the Go\nDate: Thu 25 Mar 2010\nComments  (7)\nThe BT Breakfast Club - whereâ€¦\nbrisbanetimes.com.au bloggers are this week swapping rolesâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: The Geek\nDate: Thu 18 Mar 2010\nComments  (85)\nPrev\nNext\nCompare \u0026 Save\nPopular Phones \u0026 Plans\nPhones\nDeals\nBrands\n1) Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB\n36 plans\nÂ 8%\n2) Apple iPhone 3GS 32GB\n36 plans\nÂ 2%\n3) Apple iPhone 8GB\n43 plans\nÂ 3%\n4) Nokia N97\n40 plans\nÂ 1%\n5) HTC Magic\n5 plans\nÂ 2%\nThis Guy is Not\nBob.

The trends took place amid dwindling competition, as banks took a more cautious approach to lending.\nThe big banks\u0027 share of small business lending has risen to 75 per cent, from under 65 per cent before the financial crisis, after several acquisitions among lenders.\n\u0027\u0027Competition in the small business lending market has eased from the strong levels just prior to the onset of the financial crisis, but should recover as the economy continues to strengthen,\u0027\u0027 the submission said.\nSmall business borrowers have historically paid higher interest rates than mortgage-holders because of their higher risk profile, but the Reserve said this gap had widened in the crisis. Interest rates on residentially secured business loans were 80 basis points above \u0027\u0027low doc\u0027\u0027 housing loans, compared with a gap of 30 basis points before the crisis, it said.\nTotal bank fees from business lending were worth $6.7 billion in 2008, but the Reserve said this remained a minor cost for business compared with their interest bill.\nThe main reason for the squeeze - which has tightened access to credit without crippling borrowers - was the rising risk of small business loans going bad.\n\u0027\u0027The greater increase in business rates than housing rates in large part reflects a reassessment of risk margins on business lending in light of the difficult economic and financial conditions over the past couple of years,\u0027\u0027 the Reserve said.\nDespite the tougher conditions, the Reserve said most small businesses were able to obtain the credit they needed. Further, the heavy cuts to official interest rates had more than offset the higher fees and increased margins the banks were taking on small business loans.\nA deputy governor of the Reserve, Philip Lowe, said yesterday that large businesses tended to be more optimistic than small businesses, but this division was not as marked as in the US. \u0027\u0027Conditions are tight, but unlike in the US, small business still do have access to credit,\u0027\u0027 he said in Sydney.\nJoin the conversation\n4 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nCommon Business Main Index 192 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 67 people read this\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ... 82 people read this\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 180 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 200 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nBank\u0027s breezy look at our prospects\nIt is the Reserve Bank\u0027s job to look for potential flaws in Australia\u0027s ...\nTop Small business articles\nSelling sex appeal to the States\nReserve accuses banks of squeezing small business\nBig banks squeeze small business\nWhen sharing is caring for the bottom line\nMost still use agent for tax return\nMore Small business articles\nFinance Topics\nBankingExpand (93)\nAll Banking (93)\nBank (62)\nEconomy (47)\nEconomy (47)\nBanks (28)\nDebt (27)\nLoans (21)\nLoan (19)\nWestpac (17)\nAnz (13)\nAmp (13)\nBanking (11)\nNab (11)\nNational Australia Bank (11)\nCommonwealth Bank (10)\nMacquarie (5)\nCredit Card (4)\nSt George (4)\nCba (4)\nOverdraft (3)\nCurrency (3)\nCheque (2)\nForeign Exchange (2)\nBpay (1)\nMore Banking\nAccountingExpand (76)\nAll Accounting (76)\nTax (46)\nCosts (29)\nFinancial Year (20)\nAdministration (9)\nExpenses (8)\nCreditors (8)\nAccountant (7)\nTaxable (6)\nGst (6)\nDeductions (6)\nAccounting (6)\nDebtors (5)\nBas (3)\nAbn (2)\nPayg (2)\nTax File Number (1)\nPartnership (1)\nReckon (1)\nVendor (1)\nAudit (1)\nE-tax (1)\nCompany Tax (1)\nQuicken (1)\nAccounts Receivable (1)\nPay As You Go (1)\nTfn (1)\nMore Accounting\nTaxExpand (67)\nAll Tax (67)\nTax (46)\nIncome (35)\nFinancial Year (20)\nTaxation (10)\nCapital Gains (8)\nExpenses (8)\nAccountant (7)\nDeductions (6)\nTaxable (6)\nGst (6)\nAccounting (6)\nCgt (5)\nDividend (4)\nTax-free (4)\nBas (3)\nPayg (2)\nAbn (2)\nAudit (1)\nTax File Number (1)\nE-tax (1)\nPay As You Go (1)\nTfn (1)\nGoods And Services Tax (1)\nMore Tax\nInsuranceExpand (47)\nAll Insurance (47)\nClaim (22)\nPolicy (18)\nInsurance (10)\nPremium (5)\nDividend (4)\nLiability (3)\nLife Insurance (2)\nRenewal (1)\nMore Insurance\nSuperannuationExpand (31)\nAll Superannuation (31)\nSuperannuation (25)\nRetirement (12)\nSuper Fund (10)\nContribute (9)\nRetire (3)\nTrustee (2)\nManaged Fund (2)\nCo-contribution (2)\nCompulsory Super (2)\nMore Superannuation\nPlanningExpand (1)\nAll Planning (1)\nProfit (1)\nEstablish (1)\nCapital (1)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nMore Related Coverage\nBank\u0027s breezy look at our prospects\nIt is the Reserve Bank\u0027s job to look for potential flaws in Australia\u0027s economic recovery, but its own work pretty much dispatches the prominent warning it issued yesterday about commercial property loans going sour.\nLatest Videos\nWinning Through Video More video\nPlanet-saving bacteria\nJohn West saw a unique business opportunity in muck munching bacteria.

3:37PM\nBrisbane boutique Honey Birdette will soon be selling sexy stuff to Americans.\nWhat began as a humble corner store has become an American dream come true for two Brisbane businesswomen.\nHigh-end adult shop Honey Birdette is set to open in California later this year as part of a plan to grow the business\u0027s national and international footprint.\nFounders Eloise Monaghan and Janelle Barboza have signed the lease on a new location in Los Angeles and are set to take their brand of erotica and lingerie to the US market in October.\nLocated two blocks from the high-profile Rodeo Drive shopping district, the launch of the Beverly Hills store will fulfil the pair\u0027s long-held ambition to take Brisbane-born sex appeal to the world.\nMs Monaghan, who together with Barboza launched Honey Birdette in 2005, said she was surprised by the scale of untapped potential in the States but was looking forward to filling the gap between commercial lingerie retailers and hard-core erotica vendors.\n\"The US market is similar to Australia\u0027s in that it currently spans from commercial lingerie brands such as Victoria\u0027s Secret to the much more extreme end of the spectrum,\" she said.\n\"Unlike European cities that feature sex toys in department stores and are lot more risque in general there\u0027s nothing that really capitalises on the middle ground.\n\"So there was a real space for us and our brand of high-end bedroom ware that was provocative and sensual but not extremely so.\"\nThe pair met while both working in the United Kingdom in the medical field, Monaghan for an insurance agency handling crisis communication and Barboza in cancer research for St Mary\u0027s hospital.\nBoth had studied at university in Brisbane but they didn\u0027t cross paths until their professional careers brought them in touch and they found common ground in their mutual love for the sensual lingerie available in high-end London boutiques.\nIt wasn\u0027t until Monaghan, whose mother ran lingerie shops during her childhood, had returned to Australia and went shopping for a friend\u0027s hen\u0027s night that the idea for Honey Birdette began to germinate.\n\"I couldnâ€™t believe how behind the Australian adult industry was in terms of what was on offer for women,\" she said.\n\"The whole Sex and the City phenomenon had broke, The Rabbit was part of the vernacular and yet in Australia everything seemed pretty stuck in the \u002770s.\n\"It was very much still brown paper bag, back door entry and department store lingerie.\"\nMonaghan caught up with Barboza, now working in oncology at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, and the pair began filing orders and looking for their first location.\nBeginning with a short-term lease on a site at the corner of Boundary and Vulture streets in West End, the duo realised they were onto something when their range of designer lingerie and luxury adult products began attracting positive feedback from local shoppers.\nThe former corporate career women then took sex to the city, opening their CBD store and launching a website featuringÂ  erotic fiction podcasts and international shipping information, before expanding to Petrie Terrace with the opening of their flagship store in 2009.\nWork is now underway on a Honey Birdette house lingerie label to be stocked alongside the designer French labels that dominate their shelves.\nStrong demand from American online shoppers partly contributed to the decision to set up shop in LA.\nIn fact, the store manager of Honey Birdette Beverly Hills is a persistent customer who lobbied long and hard for an LA location.\n\"We get a lot of interest from our shoppers and are approached often about opening new locations,\" Ms Monaghan said. \"But we\u0027re determined not to get ahead of ourselves.\n\"We\u0027ve always been about offering customers a personalised, unique shopping experience and we\u0027d hate to tarnish that aspect of the brand by becoming a massive chain.\"\nHowever Ms Monaghan confirmed there was still room for expansion on Australian shores and confirmed Brisbane\u0027s third boutique was set to open later this month.\nFollowing on from the existing locations at MacArthur Central in the CBD and The Barracks at Petrie Terrace, Honey Birdette will enter the mainstream retail market on Friday with a store at the Westfield Group\u0027s newly renovated Chermside shopping mall.\n\"By late 2010 we plan to have five shops nationally and may see ourselves nestled beside the likes of Louis Vuitton and other high-end retailers,\" Ms Monaghan said.\nStep number two is signing off on a new lease in the heart of Sydney\u0027s Pitt Street shopping district which Ms Monaghan said was planned for late October.\n\"And after Sydney, we\u0027ll be looking to Melbourne. It\u0027s very exciting and I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s happening.\n\"But then again, I never imagined I\u0027d be working in a shop selling lingerie and sex toys.\"\nSource: brisbanetimes.com.au\nJoin the conversation\n8 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 255 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 159 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 151 people read this\nFlight attendant reality show slammed for ... 72 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 205 people read this\nI never imagined I\u0027d be working in a shop selling lingerie and sex toys.Â \nTop Small business articles\nSelling sex appeal to the States\nReserve accuses banks of squeezing small business\nBig banks squeeze small business\nWhen sharing is caring for the bottom line\nMost still use agent for tax return\nMore Small business articles\nSmall Business Topics\nSalesExpand (20)\nAll Sales (20)\nSales (11)\nSelling (7)\nSold (5)\nStrategy (5)\nPrices (5)\nContract (2)\nPricing (1)\nDemographics (1)\nMore Sales\nMarketingExpand (19)\nAll Marketing (19)\nMarketing (15)\nAdvertising (6)\nOnline (6)\nResearch (5)\nPromotion (3)\nTv (2)\nPublicity (2)\nSeo (2)\nDirectory (1)\nSearch Engine Optimisation (1)\nMagazine (1)\nCreative (1)\nListings (1)\nPr (1)\nMore Marketing\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLatest Videos\nWinning Through Video More video\nPlanet-saving bacteria\nJohn West saw a unique business opportunity in muck munching bacteria.

The affects of some of the world\u0027s worst alcohol crimes. Graphic: Liam Phillips\nWINESTEIN UNCORKED\nWhen I floated to the office the idea of a column on what wine trends should never again enter the mainstream, it quickly transformed from a top 5 list to something like a top 20 in the space of a tweet.\nTalk soon turned from bad wine trends to spirits and, predictably, beer - for which everyone has an opinion.\nSo in the interests of those who whine about wine, and to encourage audience participation, let\u0027s cover all drinks. First, the top wine crimes:\nTOP 10 WINE TRENDS TO AVOID IN 2010\n1. Mixing OJ and bubbly\nWhy ruin a good glass of fizz with orange juice? Just serve half a glass on its own, and leave the OJ to those who really need the taste. Same goes for Midori and bubbly. Eeek!\n2. Having ice with white wine\nNot even on the hottest of days is this allowed - unless the wine is under $5. It ruins the taste and looks stupid. Sink your feet into an ice bucket if it\u0027s that hot, and sink your palate into the real flavours of the wine. Spritzers excepted.\n3. Sparkling v champagne\nChampagne is the bubbly that comes from the region of Champagne only, in France. That $12 bottle of Jacobs Creek is not.\n4. Red wine with lemonade/coke/water\nThe only people allowed to do this are Italians - usually with their own home brew because it was made in 1986 and there\u0027s still heaps of flagons in the shed.\n5. Pouring a bottle straight away\nWine is full of rich, complex intense flavours. You need to let it breathe/decant before it\u0027s at its optimum. I don\u0027t need to explain the concept of foreplay here, but it\u0027s the same thing essentially.\n6. Hibiscus flowers and strawberries\nSure it looks fancy mixed with bubbly at those B-list parties but, c\u0027mon... They go to waste and then we\u0027re left to dispose of them on the floor when no one\u0027s looking.\n7. Small wine glasses\nWe\u0027ve come a long way in recent times in realising that wine evolves better and quicker in bigger glasses (see point five). But some restaurateurs still insist on serving top-notch wine in those archaic, shapeless 200ml things. Open up!\n8. Drinking wine too cold\nThe colder your white wine, the less flavour it will impart on your palate. Most whites are drunk way too cold. The more expensive whites should be taken out of the fridge and drunk about 15 minutes later. Try it - you\u0027ll find the flavours are more robust. The same rule can apply for heavily-flavoured, Belgian-style beers.\n9. Cheap New Zealand sauvignon blanc\nThere\u0027s such an over-supply of this NZ grape, particularly from the Marlborough region, that people are confusing good value with good wine. If you really want to try a cracking sauvignon blanc from NZ, give the Cloudy Bay Te Koko a ride. Then try going back to drink that $15 crap.\n10. Being scared\nIt might seem unnatural, but swirling and sniffing your wine (in a big glass) will make the experience of drinking it doubly enjoyable. Get into it, don\u0027t worry about looking like a wine snob. Or of spilling some on your clothes. Embrace what\u0027s in your glass and let it fly open to your senses.\n10 MORE TRENDS TO AVOID IN 2010\n1. Shandy (beer and lemonade)\nWhile I don\u0027t agree with this one, die-hards out there believe beer should be drunk as just beer. Those like me who are partial to beer and lime in the morning (to get through the hangover) should also beware.\n2. Alcohol-free beer\nNeed we say more? Buy a ginger ale or something if you don\u0027t want the alcohol. Bundaberg is pretty good.\n3. Goon\nSure Goon of Fortune was a way to score a pash in your teens but there\u0027s so much great-value wine out there today that buying a four-litre cask of Coolabah (or Passion Pop for that matter) should never enter your head.\n4. Rubbish Aussie beers\nSomeone in the office takes great offence to Fosters and VB - yet drinks Tooheys Extra Dry like it\u0027s going out of fashion. Aussie draught beers have lost touch with their more fancied boutique friends like Little Creatures and James Squire.\n5. Blue Curacao\nIt resembles blue Listerine and is used in cocktails. Looks like a dream, tastes like a nightmare and, like Celine Dion, should be banned from the earth.\n6. Guinness\nWhile I can\u0027t endorse this suggestion (it came from the same person who LOVES Tooheys Extra Dry), I must admit Guinness in a can or bottle is about as awful as drinking bad medicine.\n7. Addington Draught\nApparently this is the beer of choice in Addington, Christchurch. One colleague described it as \"someone pissed on the floor, and another bloke swept it up and put it into a keg\". Sounds delightful.\n8. Umbrellas in cocktails\nThey were cool when you were little, because you had something to play with while mum and dad got boozed. Now they just get in the way and look like something from The Love Boat.\n9. Stone\u0027s Ginger Wine\nThis might have been popular back in Rotto [Rottnest Island] in 1990, but it\u0027s hideously sickly and more than just a little \u002790s.\n10. Southern Comfort and Canadian Club\nThe only time I\u0027ve felt the room spinning the next day was after drinking Southern Comfort. And the only times I find myself brawling with my brothers, is when we\u0027re all on the Canadian Club. No can do.\nIf you\u0027ve got a trend you think we need to avoid, comment below or email me here .\nFollow Winestein on Twitter by clicking here .\nSource: watoday.com.au\nComments\n22 comments so far\nOrdering spirits whilst eating in a restaurant. Especially if it\u0027s a bourbon and coke or cosmopolitan.\nRenee - March 25, 2010, 1:21PM\nThere always seems to be some new and fancy way to drink bubbly. As a kid the OJ and bubbly combo was a favourite of my mum and aunties at family gatherings. I\u0027m with David, just drink half a glass. Or perhaps it was to hide the taste of the nasty cheap bubbles!\nMore recently it\u0027s been the hibiscious flowers. I bought a jar and never used it. It\u0027s probably still lurking in the back of my fridge.\nMost recently it\u0027s been the bubbly with guava juice.\nI don\u0027t mind a champagne cocktail but if it\u0027s paired with fruit just make sure the fruit doesn\u0027t overpower the actual wine.\nWinelover | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 2:39PM\nMate, there is nothing wrong with a VB to quench a hard earned thirst.\nWolfman | Perth             - March 25, 2010, 2:35PM\nA few points on beer:\nAustralians tend to drink all ales and some lagers too cold, not just belgian beers.\nA shandy is an abomination. if you don\u0027t like the taste, don\u0027t drink beer. It\u0027s the same as your sparkling with OJ comment. Drinking fruit with your beer is also a no-no it started as a trend to try to sterilise crap beer. Some people think they are trendy drinking Hoegaarden with lemon. it\u0027s just tacky. Have a lemonade if that\u0027s what you really want.\nAlso i hope you realise James Squire is also owned by Toohey\u0027s now? And is also poisoned with corn/sugar adjuncts?\nmaybe you should stick to talking about wine...\njiffy | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 2:57PM\nI agree with all of the above comments except for the Canadian club.... that\u0027s the only drink I can drink all night and NOT get a hangover.\nIf you want to stop street violence stop selling rum.....\nAlcohol fuelled violence I don\u0027t think, more like rum related violence\nhates_rum - March 25, 2010, 2:54PM\nDavid, you may need to add another to your list. Hot drinks such as latte\u0027s, cappuccino, flat whites and hot chocolates should not be consumed after 6pm, especially after dinner. Why do we think that we need this to complete our dining experience!!\nPC | Northcote             - March 25, 2010, 3:12PM\nLook, I love a fine glass of wine and french champagne (not sparkling) but when it comes to a party, a passion pop punch with a bit of caskwine always goes down a treat. Also as West Australians our roots are with those two, they were a key beverage choice of growing up and with a jazzy new label, Passion Pop might be making a comeback\nDG | Perth             - March 25, 2010, 3:19PM\n\"Sparkling v champagne\"? Seriously, who cares what it is called? (Apart from the French, whose national sport is getting offended at the way their culture is being ruined/stolen/both by ignorant foreigners.)\nDave | Canberra             - March 25, 2010, 3:12PM\nI feel compelled to add this to the list as I have seen people try and pull this out at all occasions, once even in a restaurant (!). Jager Meister and anything at any time should be banned from 2010. After working at a bar for the majority of 2009 I have probably served 16,000 Jager Bombs to young and old and the results are in; you look stupid doing it and then you act stupid after it. But at a restaurant? Seriously??\nEthel | Mount Lawley             - March 25, 2010, 3:11PM\nI thought this would actually be an informative and educational article on wine do\u0027s and don\u0027ts. Like when to drink whites and when to drink the reds from the date they were bottled. Because I think they are different depending on the the type of wine.\nInstead I get someone who obviously did a lot of research into the topic.\nAnnabelle - March 25, 2010, 3:28PM\nShow more comments\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

It is not yet known whether the introduction of an R18+ games rating will be discussed.\nAt least 40,000 submissions were recently received by the Attorney-General\u0027s department from Australians who want an adults-only rating introduced during a public consultation process.\nJoin the conversation\n2 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 189 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 165 people read this\nSydney\u0027s warm weather here to stay 141 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 89 people read this\nPopulation growing at twice global average: ... 100 people read this\nTop Digital Life articles\nPay to play games with girls\nNew Attorney-General supports R18+ game rating\nThe e-book revolution is coming to a screen near you\nNintendo returns to 3D gaming\nDigital radio in your pocket\nMore Digital Life articles\nGames Topics\nGamesExpand (489)\nAll Games (489)\nAction (136)\nMusic (116)\nFamily (57)\nDriving (38)\nStrategy (34)\nRole-Playing (24)\nCasual game (3)\nFirst Person Shooter (2)\nMore Games\nConsolesExpand (374)\nAll Consoles (374)\nWii (187)\nPS3 (119)\nPC (100)\nNintendo DS (56)\nPSP (42)\nPS2 (38)\nXbox360 (13)\nMore Consoles\nGame AccessoriesExpand (32)\nAll Game Accessories (32)\nControllers (31)\nHeadphones (4)\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLATEST VIDEO\nDigital Life Video More video\nA decade of technology\nAt the start of the new century Facebook and Twitter didn\u0027t exist and our mobile phones had buttons.\nPlay video\nNetbooks must have THE LOOK\nPlay video\nUse the web to catch a thief\nPlay video\n2 cameras aren\u0027t better than 1\nBlogs\nSplit Screen: Metro-textual\nAficionados of Japanese games often bemoan the Englishâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: Screen Play\nDate: Fri 26 Mar 2010\nComments  (8)\nAFL Dreamteam - World of Warcraftâ€¦\nNext time some sports buff gives you grief for playingâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: Gadgets on the Go\nDate: Thu 25 Mar 2010\nComments  (7)\nThe BT Breakfast Club - whereâ€¦\nbrisbanetimes.com.au bloggers are this week swapping rolesâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: The Geek\nDate: Thu 18 Mar 2010\nComments  (85)\nPrev\nNext\nBlogs\nLatest blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nShould they tax second-hand games?\nMarch 23rd\nMarch 21st\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution\nMore blogs\nComments\nLatest comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) Maximus III Gene Motherboard  ...\nWill Facebook be more bigger than Google?\nWinners of EeePC Seashell 1001HA\nMore forums\nLatest\nFeatured products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nEAH5850 DirectCU TOP/2DIS/1GD5\nUnrivalled visual quality and intense gaming performance with DX11\nMore products\nNews\nLatest news\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nLiving in the lap of luxury\nMarch 16th\nMarch 11th\nOut with the old, or in with repairs?\nMore news\nCompare \u0026 Save\nPopular Phones \u0026 Plans\nPhones\nDeals\nBrands\n1) Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB\n36 plans\nÂ 8%\n2) Apple iPhone 3GS 32GB\n36 plans\nÂ 2%\n3) Apple iPhone 8GB\n43 plans\nÂ 3%\n4) Nokia N97\n40 plans\nÂ 1%\n5) HTC Magic\n5 plans\nÂ 2%\nThis Guy is Not\nBob.

A new website lets you do just that, if you can afford it.\nGameCrush.com is a dating site for gamers, but one built on an overtly commercial model that makes guys pay to play, while girls get paid to play with them.\nOn GameCrush guys (called \"Players\") choose a girl (called \"PlayDates\") to play with. Players then pay $US6.60 ($7.20) for about 10 minutes of gaming, and PlayDates keeps 60 per cent of the money, gaming website IGN reported.\nGameCrush said PlayDates can earn up to $US30 an hour.\nGameCrush compares the cost to buying a drink for a girl at the pub. There are about 1200 PlayDate profiles at the moment, IGN said.\nGuys can view profiles and chat for free. Afterward, the blokes can rate girls based on their gaming ability, attractiveness and flirtiness.\nThe site currently supports only Xbox Live and a few casual Flash games. The Flash games include an option to video chat while you play.\nStuff.co.nz\nComments\n30 comments so far\nWhat a sad and astonishingly cynical concept...\nEr if you were that lonely and had that much money to burn, surely you would be better served visiting a.... well you get the idea.\nAt least you\u0027d get more \u0027bang\u0027 for your buck!\nOf course I\u0027m assuming the people they\u0027re targeting are over 18 - what kid would have that sort of money to waste?\njake040 | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 10:55AM\nThis is a mild form of prostitution. I cannot believe guys would be so dumb and desperate as to pay money to game with girls. Wouldn\u0027t they want to play with girls who actually wanted to play with them, for free? Surely there are online games where they can play with real girls (not prostitutes)?\nThis is just another sad manifestion of the increasing social isolation and desperation of men who are cut off from normal avenues of communicating with the opposite sex. Time to leave your joysticks alone for a while boys, and face your fear of meeting women in person. There\u0027s nothing to fear except fear itself... we women are just your fellow human beings you know...\nHmmmm.... - March 25, 2010, 11:18AM\nIt can be time intensive trying to find talented and able women in virtual realms, so it\u0027s good to know that with a quick exchange of cash I can link up with a sheila who knows how to get right into the action. If only there were some sort of parallel in real life - some sort of industry where I could play to immediately engage flirty women in a pleasurable past-time. Unfortunately, nothing\u0027s really springing to mind.\nIt\u0027d be good to know if these ladies can tank or not. Some sort of indication of their average DPS would be good. Maybe a Warcraft Hit Score (\"W.H.ore\" value)?\nIt\u0027s great that consumers are not only going to get a score for how good they are in the games they play but how attractive and flirty they are as well. It might be one thing that a girl can head-shot a terrorist from 1000 yards or pwn zombies with a chainsaw, but if she\u0027s not hot and talking dirty too she\u0027s just another punk gamer. We demand boobs, not noobs.\nDanny K | Ballarat/Melbourne             - March 25, 2010, 11:27AM\nDanny K | Ballarat/Melbourne - March 25, 2010, 11:27AM\nWhen you said \"some sort of industry where I could play\", you meant to say PAY, right?\nHopefully you\u0027re taking the piss... one second thoughts, you must be; \"W.H.ore value\" is just too funny to be true...\nHmmmm.... - March 25, 2010, 12:00PM\nOh and Danny, I actually wish there was a similar scoring system for the guys. I\u0027ve quit so many games because of the number of guys who think they\u0027re the best gamer in the world but are completely full of their own self importance.\nAnd I don\u0027t care what they look like either, because unlike men I\u0027m actually focused on the game, not what the person on the other side of Vent is wearing.\nAilie - March 25, 2010, 12:18PM\n\" Surely there are online games where they can play with real girls (not prostitutes)?\"\nThere are heaps, but to be perfectly honest if someone wants play with me because I could \u0027flirt\u0027 with them they\u0027ll end up on my block list in half a second. I get enough hassle from men either assuming you\u0027ll be a crap player because you\u0027re a chick or just constantly hitting on you because you\u0027re a chick, I don\u0027t need anymore.\nI\u0027ve stopped telling people I\u0027m a chick at all, it\u0027s far easier.\nAilie - March 25, 2010, 12:15PM\nI love how Hmmmmm thinks everyone has the same casual approach to the opposite sex she does. Its quite disappointing that you have no insight into how hard it for some guys to interact with girls (even online).\nThere are literally millions of guys out there that throughout high school were looked down on and openly ridiculed by the \u0027popular\u0027 kids. Once they leave high school it takes years upon years of adjustment in the real world for these \u0027geeks\u0027 to even come close to being able to socially interact on a minimal level.\nSites like this, although it seems mind boggling to most people offer a chance for socially inept guys to be able to interact with people on a level they are comfortable with.\nThe price.....I\u0027m not cool with forcing these guys to pay such a fee. As it will be pretty obvious that most of the girls offering their services will be there entirely for the money and not for the interaction. But hey if it helps that social inept guy come out of his shell and allow him to begin real world interaction then it might be money well spent.\nCody - March 25, 2010, 12:13PM\nIsn\u0027t it all about \"supply and demand\"? If they want to play and pay then let them. Don\u0027t see what the big deal is really... It\u0027s a personal choice....\nCat | Sydney             - March 25, 2010, 12:32PM\nYes, I\u0027m getting my play mixed up with my pay. Could be that services such as GameCrush are already making headway in terms of confusing the two concepts.\nThough it\u0027s probably just a typo - it\u0027s difficult using the computer with one hand....\n...since one hand\u0027s more and more commonly reaching for my credit card.\nDanny K | Ballarat/Melbourne             - March 25, 2010, 12:29PM\nHAHAHA yeah you would probably want some sort of credentials to their gaming ability if you were to pay for something like this! \"Hey baby what\u0027s your gamer score on Xbox Love?\" or the lady having a profile saying \"I pull over 9000 DPS and have a 5.5k GS on my night-elf rogue\" hahahaha\nZhang | Melbourne             - March 25, 2010, 12:35PM\nShow more comments\nWould you like to comment?\nSign up for a free account\nAlready a Fairfax Digital Member?

Her classic illustrated children\u0027s books have been adapted for television, film and even ballet.\nNow Australian developer LoL Software is creating iPhone apps for a dozen of the books for the British arm of Penguin Books.\nPeter Rabbit and friends will be available to Apple iPhone and iPod Touch users later this month.\nInteractive digital applications, or apps, of Dr Seuss\u0027s The Cat in the Hat, Rachael Bermingham and Kim McCosker\u0027s 4 Ingredients (another LoL creation), The Sydney Morning Herald\u0027s Good Food Guide, and Hilary Mantel\u0027s Booker Prize-winning novel Wolf Hall are already on sale.\nThere were more than 27,000 book apps in Apple\u0027s App Store at last count, some 2000 more than there are game apps, according to mobile advertisement business Mobclix. The app store generated more than $US250 million ($A272 million) in revenue last December alone.\nIt\u0027s no wonder software developers are busily tweaking iPhone apps or developing new, graphically rich purpose-built products for Apple\u0027s much-hyped iPad tablet device.\nThis uber-gadget is exercise book-sized, looks like a blown-up iPhone, and will land in Australia in late April.\nMeanwhile, Amazon\u0027s Kindle, a handheld device for reading mainly text-based books and media, has been here since late last year. Its \"e-ink\" technology means the sensation of reading on a pixelated screen can become a thing of the past, and the range of novels available through Amazon.com has given the device mainstream appeal. \"Disposable\" genres like romance, crime and fantasy have proven particularly popular.\nForming a digital strategy\nDespite all of this, many book publishers in this country have yet to formulate a digital strategy.\nAt a talkfest on the subject last month, Federal Innovation Minister Kim Carr announced a Book Industry Strategy Group to look at how retailers, publishers, agents and authors can make the most of new technologies.\nThe working group is due to report back within a year, but is that soon enough when technologies, rookie app developers and the big international operators such as Amazon, Apple and Google, with its Google Editions e-book retail plan, are moving at such a pace?\nAustralia Council for the Arts chief executive Kathy Keele made her feelings on the matter clear at the same event last month, saying sales of e-books now constitute an estimated 5 to 6 per cent of the book market in the United States.\n\"Like many Australian consumers I excitedly opened my Kindle recently, ready to embrace this brave new world of e-books,\" she said.\n\"My excitement dropped ... once I realised that there wasn\u0027t, yet, a great deal of Australian books out there.\"\nSo why are some book publishers still working out e-book strategies?\nSurely the success of Apple\u0027s iTunes store in the music sphere gave some inkling of what was to come?\nThose who had for some years invested in e-publishing programs for their academic titles, such as Allen \u0026 Unwin and Macmillan, were well positioned to jump when the general reader did. But they didn\u0027t know how or when they would need to.\nThe Kindle had been a huge success in the US, but Amazon had given no indication as to when the device would reach Australia.\nPerhaps spurred into action by the growing buzz about the iPad and take-up of free e-reader apps for the iPhone such as Stanza, it announced a snap international launch last October.\nAmazon had the delivery method (via 3G, the third generation wireless technology most new mobile phones use today), pricing structure (around $A2.18 for classics that are out of copyright and $A10.87 for new books) and billing system (though Apple\u0027s iTunes and App stores make it even easier for us to shop).\nBut territorial rights have prevented Australian Kindle users from purchasing much other than out-of-copyright titles or those for which no local publisher owns the rights.\nA group of e-publishing pioneers had been planning last month\u0027s sold out Digital Revolution: Publishing in the 21st Century symposium for a year in a bid to address such issues.\nAllen \u0026 Unwin academic and digital publishing director Elizabeth Weiss, Macmillan digital strategy manager Victoria Nash, co-founder and director of Spinifex Press Susan Hawthorne, digital publishing consultant Anna Maguire, Australian Publishers Association industry professional development manager Dee Read and program officer at the Literature Board of the Australia Council Nicola Evans formed the Australian Publishers Association\u0027s Digital Publishing Training Steering Group, a body to ensure our industry wasn\u0027t left behind.\nTheir colleagues and competitors were keen to hear what they, and their handpicked guests had to say. They wanted to know which books they should publish digitally, when and in what form, where they should sell them, how much they should charge, and what royalty they should pay their authors.\nWeiss says the technology giants are each trying very hard to dominate in the e-book market in divergent and contradictory ways.\n\"It\u0027s challenging for the book publishing industry to establish sensible commercial relationships with them so that publishers can sustain their businesses and continue to pay authors enough to make it worth their while to write,\" she says.\nPlaying catch-up\nDuring the symposium in Sydney, speakers alluded to another reason some major publishers here are playing catch-up many are local branches of multinationals and have to fit in with head office\u0027s plans and Australia is not always the highest priority for London or New York.\nMultinationals HarperCollins, Random House, Simon \u0026 Schuster and Hachette either declined or were unavailable to comment on their e-book plans (they weren\u0027t the only ones Apple executives preferred not to comment, and Amazon ignored requests for an interview).\nPenguin Australia chief executive Gabrielle Coyne was quick to respond, though.\n\"We certainly do plan to release our mono [black ink on white paper] books as e-books as a matter of course and will be doing so as we establish our supply chain and devices become readily available to Australian readers,\" she said.\n\"We\u0027re also working closely internally and with our colleagues elsewhere in the group to review our full-colour books both on our adult\u0027s and children\u0027s lists and the best and most creative ways to make this content available.\"\nPenguin Australia last year worked with InyerPocket Software (which in turn partnered with LoL Software) to produce an app for Jungle Drums, by Animalia author Graeme Base.\nWeiss says everyone has now realised it\u0027s time.\n\"It\u0027s a revolution. Even my 81-year-old father knows about the Apple iPad,\" she said.\nWeiss doesn\u0027t believe the Australian industry is that far behind, saying most of the movement in the US has been over the past 12 months.\n\"This has developed very fast, and Australian publishers wanted to see how it developed before committing to e-book formats.\"\nAnd while the Kindle is here, it was launched without marketing or publicity backup. \"It\u0027s not in shops, and there is no dedicated Australian Amazon site,\" she says.\nApple has only just advertised for a manager for its iBooks program in the region, so the launch of its iBookstore, which is expected to sell primarily text-based mainstream fiction and non-fiction titles for the iPad, is likely to be some months away here. It will be operational in the US from early April.\nApple\u0027s iPhone Developer Program allows just about anyone with technical and creative nous to become a publisher. Pay $A108 and wade through the documentation, and you too could be creating \"e-books\" for the iPhone and iPad.\nFairfax Media\u0027s marketing and newspaper sales director Robert Whitehead warns that finding a market for your app may not be so easy, though. While sales of Fairfax\u0027s Good Food Guide apps are reportedly in the tens of thousands, this is partly as a result of cross-promotion in the group\u0027s newspapers.\n\"It\u0027s clear at this early stage that the people who succeed with apps will be those who can provide major exposure in other media outlets to generate awareness to generate the sales,\" Whitehead said. \"With 150,000 apps on the App store, for example, they don\u0027t just sell themselves.\"\nAccording to technology blog gigaom.com , there were more than 28,000 app developers out there in December. They waited an average of 4.78 days for Apple to approve their apps, and app store users downloaded an average of 4.8 apps each. A quarter of those were paid (most paid apps cost anywhere between 99c and $9.99, with an average price of $2.70).\n\"With over 58 million app store users, 280 million apps were downloaded in December, generating more than $US250 million in revenues, of which 30 per cent goes to Apple and 70 per cent to developers,\" gigaom.com reports.\nWinning new business\nLoL Software\u0027s Phil Bosua, who presented those figures at the symposium last month, says his company is winning new business by approaching publishers \"that have great content\". He has been in the publishing business for around a year. The Beatrix Potter project involves producing individual apps for a dozen of the titles, including Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin and Benjamin Bunny, as well as an app taking in all 12 titles.\nBosua says the apps will be \"true to the original books\" and focus on \"replicating the reading a book or bedtime story experience but adding narration\".\nWhere all of this leaves traditional book publishers remains to be seen.\nWeiss has been epublishing for years through her involvement in academic publishing. \"It\u0027s no coincidence that the two major publishers who have invested in e-books to date [Allen \u0026 Unwin and Macmillan] have education lists.\"\nAllen \u0026 Unwin has around 1500 e-books \"out in the world\", and the majority are trade (general rather than educational). The publisher will now release e-books at about the same time as print titles as a matter of course.\nWeiss says most trade publishers have already cleared e-book rights with their authors, but are still in the process of selecting and negotiating with e-book retailers, including Amazon and Apple.\nUntil last month, Amazon insisted on controlling pricing of e-books sold on its site, but the industry breathed a collective sigh of relief when Macmillan negotiated the right to set its own prices, and adjust them as it releases different print editions. For example, from hardback to large then small format paperbacks.\nThere are technical issues to contend with too, such as e-book file management and conversion, storage and digital rights management (access control technologies that can be embedded in an e-book to impose limitations on its usage). Another of the publishers\u0027 big concerns is piracy.\nWeiss said, \"We\u0027ve found Allen \u0026 Unwin books on file-sharing sites\".\nPirated books online are typically scanned from print titles, while the word is that others are hacked e-book files or files sourced from editorial and publicity departments.\nMaguire says readers will be driven to piracy if they can\u0027t buy the book they want legally.\n\"In the United States, 28 per cent of e-book reader owners have pirated e-books,\" she said, adding that PC World magazine found that a third of Publishers Weekly\u0027s 2009 top-15 best-selling fiction works were available for illegal download through book-swapping and file-sharing networks.\nNash says Macmillan has more than 300 trade titles on the market as e-books already, and that number will rise to 500-plus this year.\nMacmillan\u0027s Macquarie Australian Dictionary iPhone app \"has sold extremely well despite being at high price point [$29.95] for an app, demonstrating demand for quality content\", she says.\nShe too expects to sign a deal with Amazon within months, and notes that where a title is available in both a print and Kindle edition on Amazon already, 48 per cent of the retailer\u0027s sales are of the Kindle edition.\n\"Despite the hype, [digital publishing] is something that is moving,\" Nash told the publishers in Sydney. \"We have a little bit of time, but we need to work together over the next year.\"\nCharlotte Harper is web editor of The Canberra Times.\nRelated Stories (on the Canberratimes.com.au ):\n+ Good books will always succeed\n+ Physical and virtual thinking a must\n+ Finger on the digital books pulse\nJoin the conversation\n5 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\n\u0027Not too bright\u0027 thieves call bank in ... 93 people read this\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two ... 63 people read this\nSpicy sauce to punish children 60 people read this\nPay to play games with girls 6 people read this\nObama \u0027humiliated\u0027 Netanyahu at meeting 79 people read this\nTop Digital Life articles\nPay to play games with girls\nNew Attorney-General supports R18+ game rating\nThe e-book revolution is coming to a screen near you\nNintendo returns to 3D gaming\nDigital radio in your pocket\nMore Digital Life articles\nStory Tools\nShare on Facebook\nEmail this story\nPrint this story\nSMH Jobs\nLATEST VIDEO\nDigital Life Video More video\nA decade of technology\nAt the start of the new century Facebook and Twitter didn\u0027t exist and our mobile phones had buttons.\nPlay video\nNetbooks must have THE LOOK\nPlay video\nUse the web to catch a thief\nPlay video\n2 cameras aren\u0027t better than 1\nBlogs\nSplit Screen: Metro-textual\nAficionados of Japanese games often bemoan the Englishâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: Screen Play\nDate: Fri 26 Mar 2010\nComments  (8)\nAFL Dreamteam - World of Warcraftâ€¦\nNext time some sports buff gives you grief for playingâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: Gadgets on the Go\nDate: Thu 25 Mar 2010\nComments  (7)\nThe BT Breakfast Club - whereâ€¦\nbrisbanetimes.com.au bloggers are this week swapping rolesâ€¦ Â \nPosted in: The Geek\nDate: Thu 18 Mar 2010\nComments  (85)\nPrev\nNext\nBlogs\nLatest blogs\nHow do you listen to your music?\nMarch 25th\nShould they tax second-hand games?\nMarch 23rd\nMarch 21st\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution\nMore blogs\nComments\nLatest comments\nWIN an ASUS Maximus III Gene Motherboard valued at RRP $359\nASUS are giving you the chance to WIN an ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) Maximus III Gene Motherboard  ...\nWill Facebook be more bigger than Google?\nWinners of EeePC Seashell 1001HA\nMore forums\nLatest\nFeatured products\nG73Jh\nâ€¢Understated, subtly aggressive design inspired by the iconic F-117 stealth  ...\nEAH5850 DirectCU TOP/2DIS/1GD5\nUnrivalled visual quality and intense gaming performance with DX11\nMore products\nNews\nLatest news\nASUS unveils its first e-reader - DR-900\nMarch 18th\nLiving in the lap of luxury\nMarch 16th\nMarch 11th\nOut with the old, or in with repairs?\nMore news\nCompare \u0026 Save\nPopular Phones \u0026 Plans\nPhones\nDeals\nBrands\n1) Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB\n36 plans\nÂ 8%\n2) Apple iPhone 3GS 32GB\n36 plans\nÂ 2%\n3) Apple iPhone 8GB\n43 plans\nÂ 3%\n4) Nokia N97\n40 plans\nÂ 1%\n5) HTC Magic\n5 plans\nÂ 2%\nThis Guy is Not\nBob.

ARU officials stressed the importance of helping a club \u0027\u0027with such strong traditions\u0027\u0027, even if it means not fielding teams in the lower grades. While Parramatta\u0027s colts numbers are healthy, their senior ranks are understood to be of second/third grade standard, prompting fears they will be repeatedly thrashed this season.\nSome officials have admitted privately that the club will be considerably weaker than last season, when they won just two first-grade games out of 22. NSW officials have opted to see how Parramatta fare against Southern Districts in a trial tomorrow before deciding whether the Two Blues have a future in the Shute Shield.\nDue to Parramatta\u0027s plight, there have been suggestions their place in the Shute Shield be taken by a team from Canberra.\nNSWRU chief executive Jim L\u0027Estrange said last night that the club\u0027s future had been discussed at several meetings this month, including discussions with ARU officials John O\u0027Neill and Matt Carroll.\n\u0027\u0027We have had many meetings on this issue which have involved the ARU and Parramatta, while all the general managers of the clubs have been addressed on this issue,\u0027\u0027L\u0027Estrange said. \u0027\u0027Everyone is trying to find a solution to keep Parramatta in the Shute Shield. The reality is that this weekend, when they play Southern Districts, will be a very important test for the club. There are serious questions about depth, including the amount of players in key positions, such as prop and second row, where the word is that they are a little light on.\n\u0027\u0027A decision will be made involving Parramatta, ARU and the NSWRU next week.\u0027\u0027\nThe meeting, which is expected to be held on Tuesday, is scheduled to discuss ways of propping up the club. One solution might be a temporary funding model that will enable Parramatta to bolster player ranks and fill areas where they are short. Another area that needs addressing is the problem of their best players being poached by other clubs.\nParramatta are scheduled to start their Shute Shield competition on April 10 against Manly at Manly Oval.\nJoin the conversation\n17 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm 220 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 157 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 265 people read this\nCommon Business Main Index 424 people read this\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor 319 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nNo miracles expected as Beale recalled to lift NSW attack\nDo not expect Kurtley Beale to produce a flurry of \u0027\u0027miracle plays\u0027\u0027 ...\nCup coming too soon for Wallabies, says Jones\nThe Wallabies are on the improve, but next year\u0027s World Cup in New ...\nHow to play the Blues: go hard, then go harder\nA new week presents new challenges.

He cited Arsenal football manager Arsene Wenger when he was sounded out for the England job. \u0027\u0027He said you don\u0027t control the players you have as a national coach,\u0027\u0027 Jones said. \u0027\u0027It\u0027s very true.\n\u0027\u0027You have all these good young players coming through. Look at this Waratahs [squad with] the average age of 23. Now, they are going to be at their best when their average age is 27. I\u0027d imagine at Super 14 you probably need an average age of 27 and an average 40 caps per player. \u0027\u0027You don\u0027t control that as a national coach. You just get the players coming through. That is what I am saying. It just might be a little early for Australia.\u0027\u0027\nJones is excited about the Australian players now developing, especially the \u0027\u0027outstanding\u0027\u0027 Queensland Reds No.9 and No.10 pairing of Will Genia and Quade Cooper - both new Wallabies.\n\u0027\u0027Genia [because he is] a running halfback,\u0027\u0027 Jones said. \u0027\u0027He has also got a beautiful pass and with the quick ruck ball he has been terrorising ruck defenders.\n\u0027\u0027Quade is the best 10 at varying his alignment.

But according to one Brumbies insider, he has also been given the nickname to go with the position - well, make that two. Take your pick. There is \u0027\u0027Garrick\u0027\u0027 - after former Wallaby Garrick Morgan. Or there is \u0027\u0027Slaughter\u0027\u0027 - after the 1991 World Cup-winning lock Rod \u0027\u0027Slaughter\u0027\u0027 McCall. Premature? You be the judge.\nPlayer to watch: All eyes will be on Julian Huxley when he comes off the bench - assuming he gets the call. His is a tremendous comeback from a brain tumour.\nNSW WARATAHS\nPosition: 4th - 18 points\nLast week: v Western Force, Perth, won 14-10\nThis week: v Blues, SFS, tomorrow\nSidelines: Out - Hendrik Roodt (ankle/syndesmosis, 6 weeks), Adam Freier (back, 2 weeks).\nIn - Wycliff Palu (hamstring), Al Baxter (calf)\nInside word: Wallabies and Waratahs hooker Adam Freier is set to make his return to the game at club level in two weeks after an off-season back operation. Freier\u0027s last game was in last year\u0027s Shute Shield grand final against Sydney University, which his Galloping Greens lost. Randwick\u0027s opponents in this year\u0027s Shute Shield opener are â€¦ the Students. And word is Randwick have unfinished business to settle at the University Oval clash.\nPlayer to watch: Rob Horne. After a long and frustrating journey he returns to the starting side after overcoming his hamstring woes.\nQUEENSLAND REDS\nPosition: 7th - 15 pts\nLast week: Bye.\nThis week: v Cheetahs, Bloemfontein (4.10am tomorrow, Sydney time)\nSidelines: Out - Daniel Braid (hamstring), Morgan Turinui (omitted from tour), Richard Kingi (hamstring), James Horwill (knee, season).\nInside word: From South Africa where 400g steaks are a snack, coach Ewen McKenzie dispatched the Reds bunker: \u0027\u0027Protein is not a problem.\u0027\u0027 Well, that put everyone at ease. Not that the trip was hiccup free. Somehow, their video equipment lobbed in Honkers before arriving in Jo\u0027burg late. Calm was restored, when their laundry came back from the hotel service early and with everything in the right bags.\nPlayer to watch: Jake Schatz. The 19-year-old will replace injured openside breakaway Daniel Braid. This will be Schatz\u0027s third start this season.\nWESTERN FORCE\nPosition: 14th - 1 point\nLast week: v Waratahs, Perth, lost 14-10\nThis week: v Bulls, Perth, tomorrow\nSidelines: Out - Ryan Tyrrell (neck, season), Sam Wykes (thigh), Joelin Rapana (broken hand, 3 weeks), Andre Pretorius (hamstring, season), Cameron Shepherd (quad, 4 weeks), Richard Brown (dislocated shoulder, 1-2 weeks), David Pocock (finger tendon, 1-2 weeks).\nIn - Pec Cowan (neck, to bench).\nInside word: The Force may be winless but they\u0027re not short of ambition. Centre Mitch Inman, a political science student at uni, was asked in last week\u0027s match program: \u0027\u0027If you had the power to change one thing, what would it be?\u0027\u0027 He replied: \u0027\u0027â€¦ preventing world poverty would be the one thing I would like to change.\u0027\u0027 Geez â€¦ talk about putting the barrier up high.\nPlayer to watch: Scott Staniforth, if he plays.\nToby Robson of The Dominion Post writes:Â \nHURRICANES\nIn the news: Carl Hayman wonâ€™t be choosing Taranaki cow cud and a pair of gummies over a gizzillion euros a second in France. Idiot! As well as Hayman missing out, big time, it means no dream front row for the Hurricanes. Teamtalk wonders what all the fuss is about. Is Hayman that much better than Neemia Tialata anyway? In a word, no.\nPhysioâ€™s table: Cory Jane (concussion); Hosea Gear (knee), possible this week.\nThe good: Halfback Tyson Keatsâ€™ efforts against the Bulls. Quick, simple service off the deck seemed to spark more urgency in the attack. The Hurricanes defence wasnâ€™t bad either, holding out the Bulls with 14 men after Victor Vitoâ€™s sinbinning.\nThe bad: Rolling mauls and Garry Owens have left the Hurricanesâ€™ modern day tech-savvy, metro-sexuals searching for answers. Men like Jeremy Thrush, Victor Vito, Alapati Leiua and David Smith have Facebook and iPods mastered, but in recent weeks have been asked to deal with rugbyâ€™s equivalent of a Commodore 64 and a gramophone.Â \nBLUES\nIn the news: Rene Ranger. Up on assault charges for an incident out of season. Pity about the timing â€™cos Ranger is close to the best thing going between the white lines this season.\nPhysioâ€™s table: None.\nThe good: Joe Rokocoko. Credit where creditâ€™s due. The Rocket-man could have disappeared offshore, but heâ€™s fighting hard for his All Black jersey and doing a pretty good job on the end of an increasingly exciting Blues backline. On that note, itâ€™s great to see an Auckland-based rugby team playing with confidence and flair.Â \nThe bad: The way players that leave the Hurricanes region always look better for their new team. Alby, come home!Â \nCHIEFS\nIn the news: Sione Lauaki pleads guilty to an assault charge, continuing the mortgage heâ€™s taken out on this slot â€“ unfortunately. Every time the big loose forward has an off-field mishap, Teamtalk wonders what his test career should have been.\nPhysioâ€™s table: None.Â \nThe good: Finally injury free after the bye and fresh from a week with All Blacks scrum guru Mike Cron, this week wonâ€™t have done the Chiefs any harm at all.\nThe bad: Mils Muliaina is the subject of a Sunday newspaper story about \"golden oldies\" in the Super 14. Heâ€™s only 29! The same story described Keven Mealamu, 31, as \"practically an antique\". By storyâ€™s end Teamtalk was wearing a brown cardigan and boat shoes, putting the kettle on and retiring to the study to read New Zealand Gardener.\nCRUSADERS\nIn the news: Second-five Ryan Crotty turns a common womenâ€™s dilemma on its head in asking: \"Does my bum look too small in these shorts?\" Crotty told The Press: \"All those comments of the small midfielders were starting to get to me and Tim [Bateman], so we put in a bit of extra training in the off-season.\" Crotty can now strut his stuff on the field and feel comfortable in his jeans while socialising. And Ryan, no, your bum does not look too small.\nPhysioâ€™s table: None.\nThe good: Having Colin Slade as your backup first-five when Dan Carter needs a week off.Â \nThe bad: Having to play the Hurricanes after the bye round. Falling victim to Teamtalkâ€™s subtle Yoda-like mind games â€“ \"Lose to the Hurricanes you will.\" And yes, I did have the Star Wars box set growing up.Â \nHIGHLANDERSÂ \nIn the news: Otagoâ€™s fans renew their mid-90s love affair with referee Colin Hawke, who as TMO ruled out wing Fetuâ€™u Vainikoloâ€™s try against the Sharks.\nPhysioâ€™s table: Tom Donnelly, doubtful this week; Nasi Manu.\nThe good: The Lions are coming to town. Thatâ€™s the winless South African version that the Highlanders play this weekend. Lose this one and the old couch thatâ€™s been faithfully turning up on the Carisbrook terraces might head back to its student flat.\nThe bad: Whatâ€™s happened to Otagoâ€™s rugby stocks? There are only 11 players in the squad officially aligned with Otagoâ€™s NPC team and Teamtalk counts only four that are actually local products.Â \nSOUTH AFRICA WATCH\nSharks coach John Plumtree speaks for everyone with an honest appraisal of the Super 14â€™s current travel demands after his sideâ€™s win over the Highlanders: \"I am not going to miss this format, not at all.\" The Sharks match against the Hurricanes this Saturday will mark their fifth week on the road.\nJoin the conversation\n2 people are reading this now.\nComment on Twitter .\nRead tweets .\n+ People who read this also read...\nRugby Heaven 17 people read this\nARU joins battle for Parramatta and the ... 12 people read this\nComeback kid, all is forgiven: Matty goes ... 154 people read this\nTop 10 Sydney pizzas 95 people read this\nRugby Heaven Super 14 Fixtures 7 people read this\nRelated Coverage\nARU joins battle for Parramatta and the west\nParramatta, under threat of being axed from the Shute Shield competition ...\nNo miracles expected as Beale recalled to lift NSW attack\nDo not expect Kurtley Beale to produce a flurry of \u0027\u0027miracle plays\u0027\u0027 ...\nCup coming too soon for Wallabies, says Jones\nThe Wallabies are on the improve, but next year\u0027s World Cup in New ...\nHow to play the Blues: go hard, then go harder\nA new week presents new challenges.

Text Version .\nNEWS | MYCAREER | DOMAIN | DRIVE | FINANCE | MOBILE | RSVP | TRAVEL | WEATHER\nÂ \nnetwork map | member centre\nÂ \nwww.smh.com.au\nHistory of The Sydney Morning Herald\nJohn Fairfax, who bought control of the Sydney Herald in 1841, beginning his family\u0027s 149-year long control of the paper he later renamed The Sydney Morning Herald.\nTHE BIRTH OF THE HERALD April 18, 1831\nThe Sydney Morning Herald began life as the weekly Sydney Herald. It cost 7d, had just four pages and only 750 copies were printed. The paper, named after Scotland\u0027s Glasgow Herald, was founded by Englishmen Alfred Ward Stephens, Frederick Stokes and William McGarvie, who all worked for the Sydney Gazette.\nThe trio\u0027s new paper was initially based in Redman\u0027s Court, near George Street. Ten years later, John Fairfax (pictured left) began his family\u0027s 149-year long control of the paper. The bankrupt Englishman had published the Leamington Spa Sketch Book before migrating to New South Wales in 1838.\nThe paper became a daily in 1840, two years before it was renamed to its present masthead. The front page carried nothing but notices and advertisements, with news buried at the end of page two. Its editorial policies were based \"upon principles of candour, honesty and honour... We have no wish to mislead; no interest to gratify by unsparing abuse or indiscriminate approbation.\"\nGOLD RUSH May 28, 1851\nA gold discovery near Bathurst made the Herald nervous. It wrote: \"should our gold prove to be abundant ... let the inhabitants of New South Wales and the neighbouring colonies stand prepared for calamities far more terrible than earthquakes or pestilence.\" The calamities may not have eventuated as predicted, but soon after the paper brought a rotating cylindrical press to replace the slower flat bed press. It had also switched to wider columns and a smaller font to give room for more advertisements. Illustrations had appeared a decade ago. The paper remained dependant on ships for news, with no telegraph connection between Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide until 1858 or international link until the 1870s.\nFEDERATION January 2, 1901\nBy the time of federation, the Herald had become a Sydney institution and had broadened its news sources, using its first foreign correspondents during the Boer War in southern Africa, just two years earlier. Its price had tumbled, with 16 pages now costing a single penny. For half a century, people had used the paper\u0027s nickname, coined by a satirical journal which called it a \"lachrymose old Granny\".\nGALLIPOLI May 3, 1915\nThe ANZAC attack on the Gallipoli peninsula was doomed from the outset. The spot was poorly chosen and communications were inadequate. Forty-six thousand allied soldiers and 87,000 Turks would lose their lives in a campaign lasting eight months.\nBut the day after the landing, the paper reported it as a small victory of sorts, rather than the disaster it became.\nThis front page came eight years after the Herald first used photographs and at about the time typewriters appeared at the paper.\nBODYLINE BOWLING January 20, 1933\nBodyline bowling - fast, short-pitched and directed at the batsman\u0027s body - was employed by English cricketers trying to stop the indomitable Don Bradman (pictured left) and win back the Ashes from Australia in the summer of 1932-33.\nThe editorial page suggested a radical alteration of the rules was the only solution to England\u0027s tactics, which the Australian Cricket Board labelled unsportsmanlike.\nBy then, the paper had moved to new Hunter Street premises in 1929, purpose-built just before the Wall Street crash.\nThe Herald launched its new women\u0027s supplement in the same year, and celebrated its 30,000th edition a year later.\nFRONT PAGE NEWS April 15, 1944\nNews finally made the Herald\u0027s front page. Of Australia\u0027s metropolitan newspapers, only the West Australian was later to make the change. The Times in London resisted the trend until 1966.\nThe change came only after substantial debate. Some felt it would tarnish a newspaper\u0027s image to publish news ahead of public and advertising notices created by the community.\nThe Herald, on the other hand, said there was \"an urgent public demand in these critical days for ... more news.\" A shortage of newsprint and \"a deep sense of responsibility\" also led the proprietors to reduce advertisements to make room for news.\nKOREAN WAR OVER July 26, 1953\nThe front page of the four-year-old Sunday Herald declared the Korean War was nearing an end.\nIt was an expansive time for Fairfax. In 1951, it launched The Australian Financial Review as a weekly paper.\nIn 1953 it bought the 40-year-old Sun, only to merge its Sunday edition with the Sunday Herald the same year to form the Sun-Herald. In the same year, the Herald moved from Hunter Street to Broadway (pictured left).\nIn 1956, John Fairfax Limited became a public company to raise capital to fund its expansion.\nMAN ON THE MOON July 22, 1969\nThe front page carried the famous picture of the Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin landing, and announced the start of their return journey to Earth. In a busy decade for newspapers, John F Kennedy was assassinated (1963), decimal currency was introduced (1966), Harold Holt drowned (1967) and Australian troops went to (1965) and returned from (1972) Vietnam.\nThe Herald went through its own changes. In 1966 it ran its first colour advertisement, while in 1969 the paper was divided into two sections: news and business/sport. It reached 100 pages for the first time the same year, while in 1971, the first features page appeared.\nTHE DISMISSAL November 12, 1975\nThe day after Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was dismissed by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, the Herald took the unusual step of publishing its views in a front page editorial.\nThe editorial line continued inside. It declared: \"In the past three years, we have suffered, in the name of reform, a far ranging assault on our traditional way of life and its virtues of individualism and independence.\"\nThe Herald\u0027s support for the return of the conservative parties was typical of the media -- it did not support the Australian Labor Party at a federal election until 1984.\nBy the time Whitlam was sacked, the Herald had ordered its first computer system and had reached 144 pages.\nFAIRFAX FAMILY BOWS OUT December 11, 1990\nThe Herald reported the end of the Fairfax family\u0027s control of the paper with: \"It has taken Warwick Geoffrey Oswald Fairfax three years and three days to blow a family inheritance worth $500 million.\"\nThe day before, banks called in receivers and the company\u0027s debts totalled $1.7 billion.\nWarwick, great-great-grandson of John Fairfax, tried to re-privatise the listed group by borrowing $1.8 billion shortly before the sharemarket crash in 1987.\nIn the three years before those debts sent Fairfax broke, the group sold its interests in Channel Seven, AAP and Fairfax magazines (including Woman\u0027s Day, Cosmopolitan, and People).\nThe next year, Canadian media baron Conrad Black bought the Fairfax group, before it was re-listed on the stock exchange in 1992.\nNATIVE TITLE December 22, 1993\nSometimes, the long eyes of history disagree with the short-sighted news emphasis of a daily newspaper. Eighteen months before this front page, the High Court\u0027s decision in Mabo v Queensland was handed down but made only page three of the next day\u0027s Herald.\nPaul Keating\u0027s Native Title Act only just made it above the fold of this front page, giving way to the resignation of a state MP, Phillip Smiles. The Herald was in its last few years of being produced at Broadway. In 1996, the editorial department moved to the upper levels of a building at Darling Park in the city, connected by microwave link to the printers at Chullora, nearer the city\u0027s key distribution channels.\nSEPTEMBER 11 September 12, 2001\nIn the lead-up to the Sydney Olympic Games, the Herald underwent its first major design overhaul in more than 20 years. Typefaces changed and Column 8 moved to the back page alongside a news summary and a new gossip column, Spike. Metropolitan, the arts and entertainment section, also expanded.\nMore developments came after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. After the first plane hit at 10:48pm, editors reverted to the production system they had devised for the Olympics and created close to 20 pages of news over six editions during the course of the next day.\nThe Herald\u0027s website, smh.com.au, received 241,175 unique visitors on September 12, at the time its biggest day since launching in 1995, but now less than the daily average.\nNewspaper sales figures climbed as high as they had in almost 30 years.\nCompiled by Tim Dick, Joel Gibson and Amy Lawson\nNews\nBreaking News\nNational\nWorld\nOpinion\nLetters\nStrange but true\nSpike\nColumn 8\nWeather\nSpecial\nReports\nObituaries\nArchives\nHome\nEntertainment\nFilm\nTV \u0026 Radio\nMusic\nArts\nBooks\nFashion\nGood Living\nPeople\nEntertainment Â»\nBusiness\nMarket Data\nMoney\nPortfolio\nQuotes\nBusiness Network\nBusiness Â»\nSport\nLeague\nAFL\nGolf\nFootball\nTennis\nCricket\nBasketball\nMotorsport\nHorse Racing\nRugby Heaven\nSport Â»\nTravel\nAustralia\nWorld\nActivities \u0026 Interests\nShort Breaks\nDeals \u0026 Bookings\nTravel Â»\nTech\nOpinion\nReviews\nResources\nTech Â»\nOther Sections\nEducation\nHealth \u0026 Fitness\nHome \u0026 Lifestyle\nRadar\nEmployment\nProperty\nMotoring\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nCrosswords\nSMH Store\nContact Us\nSite Map\nClassifieds\nPlace an Ad\nAdonline\nAnnouncements\nNotices\nOther Classifieds\nAdvertise with Us\nClassifieds Â»\nJobs\nFind a Job\nPlace an Ad\nCars\nFind a New Car\nFind a Used Car\nPlace an Ad\nReal Estate\nBuy Property\nSell Property\nRent Property\nShare Property\nHoliday Rentals\nBusinesses for Sale\nPlace an Ad\nRSVP\nFind a Date\nBrowse for a Date\nTop 100\nRSVP.com.au\nSearch smh:\n6am: Herald day staff start waking, turning to radio, TV and the day\u0027s papers. Reporters, editors and chiefs of staff get across the breadth of news unfolding before starting work. It\u0027s news for breakfast.\n8am: The first Herald staff arrive at the city office. The copy person glances at views over much of Sydney before distributing the day\u0027s papers and the overnight mail and faxes. The news desk administrator answers calls from readers with comments, queries and tips.\n9am: The chief of staff arrives, head full of the morning\u0027s news. He or she consults with reporters, collating events of the day and allocating tasks. Advertising sales staff finalise ad space allocations and liaise with clients. The letters editor starts reading through the 500 or so letters that arrive each day.\n10.30am: Advertising sales close for the day and the ad book -- a draft flat plan of a blank newspaper with the ad space marked out -- arrives at the news desk and editor\u0027s office. Sales staff spend the rest of the day working ahead.\n11am: Morning news conference begins. This is where the paper begins to take shape. The editor, deputy editor, chief of staff, photographic editor and other editors discuss story ideas, angles and series, deciding which to pursue. The main stories and the news focus for the day are discussed. Graphics and photographs to accompany each story are planned. Early thoughts are formed on how the editorial content will be placed around the allocated ad space. The editor is in constant contact with advertising executives to coordinate space allocation, which changes frequently during the day.\n11.30am: In sections such as Metro, Domain, Good Living and My Career, journalists, designers, artists and illustrators work towards different weekly deadlines. Editors plan for next day, next week, next month. Journalists talk to readers and other contacts, wondering what they\u0027ll learn. Other journalists trawl wire services, looking for publishable stories and interesting snippets.\nNoon: Out on the job. News journalists make phone calls and attend press conferences, door stops and interviews, trawling for information on a story. They read. They think. They speak to as many people as possible to flesh out an issue and present it in a balanced way. Photographers, illustrators and artists work with journalists, creating images to complement words.\n12.30pm: The advertising department forwards a final copy of the ad book to the editor and pre-press staff. Last-minute cancellations or bookings are accounted for, as are classifieds, and the layout is adjusted. Advertising staff work to deadlines two days prior to the publication of the daily paper and constantly generate new clients for future editions.\n2pm: Night staff begins to arrive. These are the people who will take the words and images developed during the day, and turn them into a newspaper.\n4pm: Afternoon news conference starts. It\u0027s a similar group to that at morning conference, with the addition of the chief sub-editors and the night editor, who will now take over from the editor. Stories, and their angles and implications, are discussed in depth. Possible follow up stories are considered. News stories, photographs and illustrations are positioned in the paper and assigned to pages. Photographs are displayed and discussed -- sometimes a story\u0027s position in the paper will depend on the strength of the photograph. After afternoon conference, the daytime editors start to plan the following day\u0027s paper, and the night editors takes over the running of current edition. Advertising layout staff begin working on page layout for the following day, drawing up a draft ad book.\n4.30pm: The chief sub-editor begins \"copy-tasting\", reading through stories filed by reporters and allocating stories to a page within the paper. The order of news depends on the importance, timeliness and interest of each article, and the need for a good mix of stories on different subjects, throughout the paper.\n5pm: Across the newsroom, reporters rush to finish and file their stories. Facts are checked, frantic calls made, paragraphs re-written. If a story is likely to get top billing, on page one or three, the deadline may be extended an hour or two. But for most, it\u0027s now or never.\n6pm: The news editor and chief of staff watch the TV news, making sure the news of the day is covered. The inside parts of the paper -- features pages, editorials, letters and opinion pages -- are being finalised. Staff in weekly sections are off home.\n6.15pm: Another conference. This time, a small and senior group meets to decide finally what should be on page one. By this stage, the content of the rest of the paper has been decided upon. There is a shortlist of five to six stories to choose from. The conference debates the quality and newsworthiness of the potential front page stories which have already been filed, and receive updated briefings on stories still being written. If there is indecision about what should go on the front page, the editor makes a final decision.\n6.30pm: The night chief of staff reads stories as they are filed. Some are sent back to journalists for more information, or kept over to work on again the next day. Most pass muster and are sent to sub-editors, who check facts, accuracy, fairness, clarity and newsworthiness. They lay pages out on computer templates and write headlines and photo captions. Pages are re-worked as better stories, photos and graphics arrive. The only constant is change.\n7pm: Lawyers check stories for contempt of court, defamation or other problems. Everybody else is flat out, too -- this is peak hour for a daily newspaper.\n7.30pm: Most reporters have gone, some are still checking facts and finding last details to drop into stories. One lone night reporter stay until 11pm, adding to existing stories and chasing new ones. Photos, illustrations and cartoons are dropped into pages. Pages are printed out and proofed. Dinners are eaten at the computer terminal.\n9pm: The Herald\u0027s first edition is sent electronically to the printing plant at Chullora. There, computer page files are converted to etched aluminium plates for the presses. The aluminium plates are placed on metal cylinders which roll and stamp ink onto bare newspaper. For colour pages, four plates of cyan (blue), yellow, magenta and black are combined to create virtually any hue.\n10pm: Pages roll off the press and are folded and trimmed to form a newspaper. This edition is trucked all over NSW and flown interstate. Back in the office, the chief sub and the night editor review the first edition, fixing errors of style, typography and, if needed, fact. They also change stories and lay-out which don\u0027t reach the high standards expected, and drop in late-breaking news. A second edition develops.\n11pm: The second edition is sent to the printers. When done, it goes to newsagents, newsstands and shops throughout Sydney and major regional centres. Most staff are off home.\n12am: Usually, a third edition is finalised and sent to the printers. This goes to inner metropolitan Sydney. The office is now quiet apart from a couple of hardy souls.\n3am: Cleaners work at the piles of papers that accumulate each day. One person stays, monitoring police radios. If something significant happens, the chief of staff is woken and staff may be called to get out there. Otherwise, all is quiet. At Chullora, the last of the 300,000 or so papers printed each weekday is sent out.\n4am: Newsagents receive the fresh papers and wrap them in plastic, ready to be dropped on lawns and driveways and letterboxes and verandahs across the state.\n5am: The day\u0027s Herald lands on subscribers\u0027 doorsteps. Commuters and early morning walkers pick it up from newsstands, ready to digest the day\u0027s news. Back at the newsroom, the daily cycle is about to begin again.\nCompiled by Clara Iaccarino, Jacqueline Maley and Bonnie Malkin\nHome | National | World | Opinion | Business | Technology | Sport | Entertainment\nCLASSIFIEDS Jobs | Real Estate | Cars | Dating | Place a classified ad\nSitemap | Subscribe | Privacy | Contact Us | Conditions | Member Agreement |\nCopyright Â© 2005.

Read full details of what Premium Membership includes .\nBack to top\nQ - When I click on a multimedia link nothing happens, why?\nA - You may have ad-blocking software installed. Several packages can prevent pop-up windows from appearing (among them are Google\u0027s toolbar, Firewall software, and a new plugin for Norton antivirus). You will need to disable ad-blocking, or turn the sensitivity down.\nBack to top\nQ - Why is the PDF version of the frontpage blank?\nA - There are some combinations of browser and Adobe Acrobat that can make the PDF appear blank. Assuming you are using IE and Windows try this: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid\u003dKB;en-us;q177321 . The quickest solution is to upgrade your Acrobat reader.\nBack to top\nQ - Why do I get an old version of the site?\nA - This problem is most likely related to the caching of the out-of-date page at either your PC level or your ISP level. The best way around that is to hold down the control (ctrl) key and press refresh/reload. This will reload the newest version of the page from our servers.\nBack to top\nQ - Why am I getting random pop-up advertising when I return to my default home page?\nA - In nearly all cases such advertisements are not supplied by smh.com.au.\nOccasionally, our sites will serve a pop-under box on the front page only for the purposes of promoting features in our sites or newspapers. Pop-ups will also appear from time to time on sub-indexes of the site for recognised and reputable Australian advertisers.\nHowever, if you get a lot of unrecognisable advertisements popping up on visiting our sites - especially messages telling you that you have won a prize - you are being spammed.\nIt is possible that at some point whilst surfing the Internet, you visited a site that downloaded a piece of advertising spam code. You may have seen a grey box asking if you wanted to continue and clicked \"yes\". By doing this you may have agreed to download a small piece of code to your desktop that will be activated each time you launch your web browser and default home page. This will activate pop-up advertisements from elsewhere on the Web.\nUnfortunately these code insertions are not dissimilar to a virus. You will need anti-spyware or outerware, such as Ad-aware to remove this code. Downloads for this software are available here .\nBack to top\nHome | National | World | Opinion | Business | Technology | Sport | Entertainment\nCLASSIFIEDS Jobs | Real Estate | Cars | Dating | Accommodation | Place a classified ad\nSitemap | Subscribe | Privacy | Contact Us | Conditions | Member Agreement |\nCopyright Â© 2010.

If you can rise to those challenges then you will pave the way to making the day run smoothly. If these things don\u0027t fit - there could be a breakdown in communications with someone important if selfish motives are allowed into the equation. (And they don\u0027t necessarily have to be your own)! www.AstroZone.com.au\nLeo: With the Moon still in your sign you can feel pulled in a few different directions today so think carefully before you do anything important. Because it would be all too easy for small irritations to grow into anger - which is something you need to avoid. Do your very best tonight to keep the home fires burning brightly and positively. www.AstroZone.com.au\nPisces:  Holding onto old patterns will only make your life miserable - but you know that already. However knowing and doing something about it are two different things. So have a look today about your approach to money and what you can do to change any \u0027bad\u0027 habits you may have in this area of your life. Keep in mind that there is only ever Now. Tonight avoid being over dramatic to get attention. www.AstroZone.com.au\nGemini: This is a really good day for taking things seriously as you may have to account for your actions in some way to an authority type figure in order to avoid confrontations or problems. So it will pay not be too frivolous and keep the humour for another time and avoid impulsive actions too. A good day to straighten out any marital problems (if you have any of course). www.AstroZone.com.au\nVirgo: You should keep a low profile today particularly around people who are in power or have the last say. You should be mindful to honour commitments and not push anyone\u0027s limits. If you do they may break and the repercussion could be anger which is obviously something you would prefer to avoid. And again tonight is for low key activities and an early night! www.AstroZone.com.au\nScorpio: Through the morning you need to work within limitations, restrictions or boundaries because if you speak your mind or do something you really want to do but haven\u0027t got the green light for, you may find that things go wrong later in the day. This would be when someone who has more power than you can make things difficult or if you are the head honcho - well you could give those who are under you a hard time. So it behooves you to think first and act later.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nTaurus: The matter of staying positive lies with you today. You may find working behind the scenes will be better for you and help you to produce better results than being \u0027out in front\u0027 as it were. You may also find it better to stay within constraints or limitations today than run the risk of creating compromising situations for yourself. Keep things nice and simple tonight. www.AstroZone.com.au\nCapricorn:  The Sun-Pluto (exact) influence is one that can have a direct influence on your home life, family affairs or even a property mater today. If you have to deal with authoritarian people you have to be calm, in control and let them know where you stand without creating animosity. You could also have to face with a machine breaking down (or something like that). Know this - you will feel personally vindicated at day\u0027s end when things have worked out in your favour. www.AstroZone.com.au\nSagittarius: On the one hand there are some cerebral influences that can open your mind to creativity, so make a note of ideas that float through the grey matter today. On the other hand there is a call to break free from some kind of negative behavioural pattern. Look to whichever one you feel applies to you and do the work! You will derive satisfaction from those aspects of your Self that have been challenged and dealt with today.  www.AstroZone.com.au\nAries: Happy Birthday. You exude an optimistic energy today that should go a long way to alleviating the more dour energy that follows later in the day. So hold tight to that and don\u0027t let others demand too much of you nor you of they! This is an excellent day to break free from a debilitating pattern or destructive behaviour (if that\u0027s necessary of course). Avoid over exaggerating tonight to get your own way. www.AstroZone.com.au\nLibra: There are a few different energies playing out today but the main one is a strong Sun connection that can undermine business partnerships if you do not act with caution and care. But if there are difficulties within it and you can both sit down and be sensible about things then there is a real possibility of resolving issues. If not then you may find things dissolve into anger. As always the course of action you take is entirely up to you!  www.AstroZone.com.au\nCancer:  On this serious sort of day you may be called to account for something you have done in the past. And as long as you can do so there will be no problems. But if you can\u0027t then things could get a little heated. So be conscientious and do the right thing by others and within your work place so that good things will flow back to you. It\u0027s important to keep life harmonious tonight so no feathers get ruffled. www.AstroZone.com.au\nAstrozone\nAquarius\nLeo\nPisces\nGemini\nVirgo\nScorpio\nTaurus\nCapricorn\nSagittarius\nAries\nLibra\nCancer\nMotoring\nSubaru WRX gets fat\nDrive.com.au\nThe most reliable cars\nSaab restarts production\nSell your car for just $40!\nJobs\nMonthly payments could mean a super bonus\nMycareer.com.au\nWIN a job as Nova\u0027s CEO\nVisit our Salary Centre\n$100k+ Executive jobs\nReal Estate\nWin a $5,000 shopping spree in New York\nDomain.com.au\nBuy real estate\nFirst Home Buyers Guide\nTough times to stay\nManaged Funds\nSet up a FREE Personalised Investment Alert!\nManaged funds, shares...\nFind a managed fund\nMorningstar rated funds\nEssential Baby\nDo NOT bring your kids!\nwww.essentialbaby.com.au\nOvulation calculator\nDue date calculator\nDiscuss pregnancy\nCompare and Save\nBroadband\nEnergy\nMobile\nHome Loans\nSavings Accounts\nCredit Card Heaven\nSpend hard, play hard, credit cards.\nCompare all Credit Cards\nCheaper Home Loans\nChop your loan down to size - low fees and lower rates!\nCompare all Home loans\nHigh Interest Accounts\nAustraliaâ€™s most wanted savings account just hit 5.95%\nCompare all Savings Accounts\nUnlimited Plans on iPhone\nCarriers update their iPhone plans with unlimited calling options.\nCompare Mobile Phones \u0026 Plans\niPad 3G - Be First\nBe the first to get an iPad 3G on a mobile broadband plan.\nCompare all Broadband Plans\nReaders\u0027 most viewed\nMost viewed articles on Brisbane Times\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nMost viewed articles on WA Today\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nAlison Braun enjoys high tea at low weight\nFun flirtation or hurtful cheating?\nHigh tea in fashion\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nMost viewed articles on The Age\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nFabulous flats\nWomen\u0027s fat fight gets harder\nMost viewed articles on The Sydney Morning Herald\nTop 5 Life \u0026 Style articles\nBullock\u0027s marriage over: report\nNew claims against Hey Dad actor\nPolice not aware of complaints against Hey Dad! star\n25 years on, police reopen inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey\u0027s daughter\nBullock\u0027s husband cheated on her with two other women: report\nVideos\nGeorge Bush in Haiti hand wiping storm\nBye Mr Shuffles, Hello Pathi Harn\nHot lap: Albert Park in 200 km/h Merc\nMan fined for tooting horn\nEddie regrets gay remarks\nSMH Home\nNSW\nNational\nWorld\nEnvironment\nOpinion\nBusiness\nTechnology\nDigital Life\nEntertainment\nLife \u0026 Style\nTravel\nCars\nExec Style\nSport\nWeather\nSydney Morning Herald\nSitemap\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPrivacy\nConditions\nAdvertise with Us\nPhoto Sales\nProducts \u0026 Services\nAM Today\nLast 8 days\nHigh Contrast\nText\nNewspaper subscription\nShop\nSEO\nConnect\nMobile\nNewsletters\nRSS\nTwitter\nFacebook\nClassifieds\nAccommodation\nCars\nDating\nJobs\nReal Estate\nProperty Price Data\nTributes \u0026 Celebrations\nPlace an ad\nOur Sites\nThe Age\nSydney Morning Herald\nWA Today\nBrisbane Times\nBusiness Day\nMoney Manager\nInvestSMART\nÂ \nTrading Room\nRugby Heaven\nLeague HQ\nReal Footy\nWeatherZone\nEssential Baby\nFairfax Digital Network\nFairfax Digital\nCopyright Â©\nFairfax Digital\n",
