But if you change your mind about your purchase, you can return your contact lenses for a refund or exchange provided that the items are still in their original condition.\nGuide to Buying your Online Contact Lenses\nOnline transactions can be tricky, especially if you\u0027ve never gone through the motions before. The following is a quick guide that can help you make the right decisions.\nUse a current prescription\nPrescriptions do not always remain the same. Over time, your optometrist may alter your prescription based his updated evaluation of your eyes. Prescriptions are constantly changed to address any new problems or compliment any progress.\nDo not place an order with a dated prescription.  Use your most recent prescription when ordering online. If you have misplaced this, consider approaching your optometrist for a replacement. Check the date of your prescription. If it\u0027s older than 12 months, you may want to consider getting any new one.\nYour prescription will include your\nName\nPrescription expiration date\nName and contact details of the prescriber\nPower for the lens\nBase curve\nMaterial\nExamination date\nDiameter\nThe name of the brand/manufacturer.\nCheck your Order Twice before submitting it\nTake your time before making your order. Don\u0027t be quick to make a decision. Before you click the submit button, ensure that the contact lens that you are buying fits with your prescription. Pay attention to the lettering. It is important that you choose the right fit for your eyes or this may lead to long term complications. Correcting your order may also extend the processing period which will delay your delivery.\nDiscuss with your Optometrist about Substitute lens\nContact lenses Online is stocked with dozens of different brands (International and Australian). On rare instances, we may not have the particular brand that you are searching for in stock. But you are likely to find an equally suitable alternative. If you are unsure about the proffered substitute, consult with your optometrist. Your doctor will be able to suggest alternative brands that will still fit with your prescription.\nCheck the expiration date on the package.\nAll our contact lenses are sold within their outlined lifetime. Using dated lenses may damage your eye. Check your package when it is delivered. If you should receive a delivery with an expired date, return it immediately and we will immediately send a replacement.\nCheck the Product\nBefore you unpack the contact lens and put it on, check to make sure that your order is the right one and fits with your need. Your package should be the brand you ordered with the exact name and sphere. Other details include the base curve, diameter and cylinder. If your package is the wrong one, please return it immediately for a replacement. It is risky to use contact lenses that do not match your prescription.\nDon\u0027t skip your regular eye examination\nContact lenses online offers high quality vision correction solutions. But that doesn\u0027t mean that you no longer need an eye examination. Do not skip your annual or bi-annual eye examination. This will ensure that you are always using the best possible setting for your needs. As your eyesight improves, your doctor may alter your prescription to enhance the corrective factor. Regular visits will also ensure that your eyes aren\u0027t being overly strained with regular use or infected.\nContact Lenses Online: Beyond Your Order\nContact Lenses can be used to safely correct vision. But only if they are used the right way. Make sure that you buy contact lenses for the right reasons. It is the only way of guaranteeing that your eyes remain healthy.\nBefore buying your contact lens, it is advised that you go for an eye examination. The results of the eye exam can be used to determine if you are a right candidate for contact lenses and which lens is the right fit for your needs. Your optometrist will provide you with the right measurements for your contact lens and will also offer assistance and advice on how you can take proper care of them.\nContact Lenses: Things you should know\nWhy do you need a Prescription? Contact lenses are not toys. Wearing contact lenses without a proper prescription fitted by your optometrist can be harmful to your eyes.   Poorly fitted lens or contact lenses made from the wrong kind of material can very easily damage your eyes. It increases your risk of infection and could lead to permanent tissue damage.\nDiscussing with an optometrist will also make it easier choosing the right contact lens. Contact Lenses online is home to a vast selection of lenses. Making the right decision can be overwhelming if you aren\u0027t already familiar with the different options. Learning more about contact lenses and the different materials that they are made from can help you make the right decision. For instance, some contact lenses are designed to be replaced while others can be worn for extended periods. You\u0027ll also find decorative contact lenses and silicone hydrogel lenses among other options.\nHow to Care for your Contact Lens: Quick Tips\nYour package has arrived and you\u0027re the proud new owner of a new set of contact lenses. Now what? The following will help you get the best out of your new purchase.\nAlways follow the product instructions or those of your optometrist when cleaning your contact lens. Rinse your contact lens carefully before soaking it in cleaning solution. Ensure that the lens is completely covered.\nDo not swim or enter a hot tub while wearing your contact lenses. Follow the use and replacement guidelines recommended by your physician.\nNever attempt to clean your lens by putting it in your mouth. Saliva is not an acceptable cleaning solution. Doing this will only expose you to a possible infection.\nDo not use product that have not been recommended by your optometrist to disinfect and clean your contact lenses. Always clean your contact lenses with fresh solution. Do not re-use old solution as this will increase you risk of catching an infection.\nKeep your hands clean and dry before handling your contact lens. Change your contact lens solution everyday even if you only use your contact lenses periodically.\nAbove all, it is important to remember that your contact lenses are medical tools and need to be treated with the right amount of care. Use your contact lenses carefully. Wearing your contact lens for extended lengths may lead to redness, sore eyes or blurry vision.\nDo not share your contact lens with other people. This includes prescribed contact lenses and colored lenses used for cosmetic ends.\nMore contact lens care tips can be found here and here .\nNo two people have the same eyes and so the contact lenses which is best for someone else may not be the best for you. For the latest information regarding this you should visit your optometrist or eyecare professional.\nContact Lenses\nFaq\nTerms \u0026 Conditions\nHealth Funds\nPrivacy\nContact Us\nAbout Us\nArticles\nBlog\nLinks\nContact Lenses Online is to be used as a contact lens replacement service only.

Google moving companies to find there are lots of them.Â Which mover can we trust? The two guys on the Conroy Removals website look trustworthy.Â Decide to fill out the Request a Quote form on the website.Â  Not too hard but it makes us think about what is in each room and do we really want to take it?\nDay 2\nThe quote for our move arrived in the email this morning.Â Price looks ok but they suggest that they do a proper survey of our stuff to make sure of the size of the load.Â Probably a good idea.Â We need a big removal van.Â Called Conroys to make a time and their representative is coming this afternoon.Â Nice man with a relaxed but professional attitude.Â He answered all our questions and seemed to know what he was doing. I feel much more relaxed about the move now.\nDay 3\nThe removal quote from Conroys arrived in the post this morning. Filled out the acceptance form and sent it back.Â Had to be careful working out the removal insurance because we will be getting rid of some stuff.Â We were lucky and got the last time slot for our removal on our moving day.\nDay 4\nPaid for the removal and checked details of the booking with Conroys. Time to go through the Removals Check list supplied by Conroys to make sure we have taken care of the details.Â Lots of things to check.\nDay 5\nThe day before the packers arrive. Received a text message from Conroy Operations centre confirming the arrival time of the packers tomorrow at 8am\nDay 6\nThe packers arrived just after 8am.Â They are quicker than I thought and I had to watch carefully to make sure they didnâ€™t pack items which we are not taking but have not got rid of yet.Â  Itâ€™s a weird feeling watching your house being taken apart but at least I can see it is all being packed and wrapped carefully.Â Tomorrow the removal van comes to load it all up.\nDay 7\nThe van arrives and Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s too small.Â The guys assure me that it will all fit in.Â They put it together like a jigsaw puzzle and 5 hours later the house is bare and the van doors closed.Â Itâ€™s time for us to leave and let the house cleaners, arranged by Conroys, to come in and make the house ready for the new owners.\nDay 8\nWe have now arrived inÂ Brisbane and await the arrival of the removal van at our new address.Â The driveway is longer and more difficult than our previous one inÂ Townsville but the driver skillfully reverses the van almost to the door.Â With two assistants helping the unloading begins and I am kept busy making sure that the cartons and furniture are delivered to the appropriate rooms.Â  We have chosen to unpack the boxes in our own time.Â We will call Conroys later to come and pick up the flattened boxes and packing material.Â Maybe, if we ever move again, we will consider the full unpack option which Conroys provide.\nWhen the unloading is completed the guys assemble our beds and other pieces of furniture which have been dismantled for transport.\nDay 9\nThings are still a bit chaotic as we unpack and put things away, but order is slowly starting to assert itself in the house. The Conroy representative from Townsville, who did our removal survey and quotation, called to see how it all went and wish us well.Â Nice touch.Â Overall it has gone very well.Â Any problems were quickly dealt with by Conroy staff.Â We would definitely recommend Conroy Removals to our friends.\nCall Conroy Removals on 1800 640 774\nMore: Moving Information | Moving Planner | Moving Forms | Moving Diary | Moving On Newsletter\nHome | Why Choose Us? | Moving Services | Moving Information | Moving Quote | Contact Us | Privacy Policy | Conroy Removals New Zealand\nCopyrightÂ© Conroy Removals Ltd. 2008 - 2009\n",

Hereâ€™s a list of some frequently used financial terms.\nAge Pension:Â a social security benefit paid by the Federal Government to people who have reached the qualification age, being age 65 for men and between ages 63 and 65 for women, depending on when they were born. The amount of pension paid (if any) is determined by the income test and the asset test.\nAllocated pension:Â also known as an â€˜account-based pensionâ€™. This type of pension allows you toÂ withdraw regular income payments until your balance is reduced to zero. Allocated pensions are usually established using your super savings to fund your retirement, but may also be commenced using a non-preserved cash benefit, total and permanent disability payment, terminal illness benefit, or a death benefit.\nThe value of your account moves up and down according to the investment earnings you receive and the amount of income you withdraw. If you are 60 or over, you pay no tax on the income payments you withdraw. You are required to withdraw a minimum percentage as income each year, based on your age. Your capital can be withdrawn at any time as a lump sum (provided eligibility criteria are met). There is no guarantee that your account balance will last your lifetime.\nAnnuity:Â a regular income stream paid in return for a lump sum investment, usually for the purposes of retirement income.\nAssessable income:Â income earned before allowable deductions.\nAssets:Â possessions or property.\nAsset test:Â The assets test is used to reduce the amount of age pension that a person is entitled to receive where the value of their assets counted for assets test purposes (generally all assets other than the principal home) exceeds a certain threshold. A personâ€™s age pension entitlement will reduce to nil on a sliding scale based on the amount by which the personâ€™s assessable assets exceed the threshold.\nBeneficiary:Â a person entitled to receive funds or property under a trust, will or a binding/non-lapsing death benefit nomination held within a super fund.\nBinding death benefit nomination:Â a legally binding nomination a member can make to the trustee of a super fund in relation to their benefit (where the trustee has elected to accept nominations). The nomination outlines to whom a death benefit will be paid in the event of the memberâ€™s death.\nCapital:Â the total wealth owned or used by an individual or business.\nCapital gain/growth:Â the increase in the market value of an investment.\nCentrelink:Â an Australian Government statutory agency that helps people become self-sufficient and supports those in need.\nCompound interest:Â interest that is calculated on the amount invested plus interest previously earned and left in the account. This is sometimes called â€˜earning interest on your interestâ€™.\nConcessional contributions:Â taxable contributions made to a super fund. Concessional contributions may include employer contributions (including the 9% super guarantee contribution), salary sacrifice contributions, personal deductible contributions and â€˜family and friend contributionsâ€™ (contributions paid to your fund by a person other than you, your spouse or your employer). Concessional contributions are subject to contributions tax and count towards your concessional cap.\nConcessional tax rate:Â a reduced tax rate applying to a certain category of investment.\nConservative:Â moderate or cautious.\nContribution:Â a deposit into a super fund.\nDeath benefit:Â a benefit equal to your super account balance paid to your dependants or legal personal representative when you die.\nDebt:Â the amount of money owed â€“ including mortgages, personal loans and credit card balances.\nDiversification:Â spreading your money across a range of investments rather than just one (eg various asset classes such as shares, property, fixed interest securities and cash) with the aim of reducing risk.\nEarning rate:Â the percentage return (income and/or capital growth) earned on an investment.\nEmployment termination payment (ETP):Â a lump sum payment made from an employer to an individual upon their termination of employment, including genuine redundancy, disablement, death or early retirement. Such payments can be taken in cash or, if eligible, may be directed to a super fund.\nEquity:Â the value of an asset after deducting any money owing on it.\nEstate:Â property and possessions of a deceased person.\nFixed interest:Â an interest rate that stays the same through the term of the loan.\nFund manager:Â a firm that provides investment management services or an individual who directs investment management decisions.\nGearing:Â investing with borrowed money.\nGrowth assets:Â assets, such as shares and property, that are expected to increase in value over the long term.\nIncome stream:Â an investment product that provides regular payments, made up of the capital you invested and earnings on that amount.\nIncome test:Â the income test is used to reduce the amount of age pension that a person is entitled to receive where their assessable income for income test purposes exceeds a certain threshold. The age pension entitlement will gradually reduce to nil on a sliding scale based on the amount by which the personâ€™s assessable income exceeds the threshold.\nInflation:Â an increase in the general level of prices.\nInterest:Â money paid in return for the use of borrowed funds. If you have money in a savings account, your bank pays you interest while it â€˜borrowsâ€™ your money. If you have a loan, you pay your bank interest while borrowing its money.\nInvesting:Â purchasing assets with the aim ofÂ making your money grow in value. For example, buying property or shares.\nLife cover:Â an insurance policy that pays a specified amount of money when the policyholder dies.\nLump sum:Â an amount of money, eg a superannuation benefit, taken as a single cash payment rather than being transferred into a pension or annuity.\nNon-concessional contributions:Â contributions made from your after-tax income. These may include personal contributions, spouse contributions and child contributions. Contributions tax is not deducted from these contributions when they are invested into a super fund, nor are they taxed when they are withdrawn, because tax has already been paid. These contributions count towards your non-concessional cap.\nOffset:Â a tax rebate that reduces the amount of tax payable.\nPension:Â a regular income stream paid to an individual, either by the government (such as the Age Pension) or by a superannuation/pension fund.\nPolicy document:Â a document that sets out the terms and conditions on which the insurer provides cover to the client.\nPre-retirement pension:Â a pension designed to supplement your income in the later years of your working life before you retire. Like an allocated pension, you must take a minimum pension payment each year. However, unlike an allocated pension, there is also a maximum permitted pre-retirement pension payment, which is calculated as a percentage of your account balance. If you are aged 60 or over, no tax is payable on your pre-retirement pension.\nPreservation age:Â the minimum age at which you can access your superannuation. Your preservation age depends on your date of birth. If you were born beforeÂ 1 July 1960, your preservation age is 55. The preservation age increases on a yearly basis untilÂ 1 July 1964, with all those born on or after this date having a preservation age of 60.\nRetired:Â for the purposes of receiving a retirement benefit, you are â€˜retiredâ€™ when you satisfy one of the following conditions:\nHÂ ave reached your preservation age, ceased employment and do not intend to ever again work more than 10 hours per week\nHave ceased employment on or after age 60 (regardless of future work intentions)\nHave turned 65 (regardless of current employment status and future work intentions).\nReturn:Â the amount of money your investment earns.\nRisk:Â the possibility that your investment may fall in value or earn less than expected.\nRollover/rolling over:Â the transfer of some or all of the balance of your superannuation money from one fund or product to another. You can rollover your super irrespective of your age or work status. A rollover does not count towards any contributions cap. No tax is withheld from your rollover.\nSalary sacrifice:Â an amount of pre-tax salary that an employee contributes to super instead of taking it as cash salary. This is in addition to the compulsory super contributions the employer makes on behalf of the employee.\nSelf managed super fund (SMSF):Â a fund thatÂ isÂ controlled and managed by the members of the fund. The members, as trustees, make all the decisions about how the fund is run, the investments it holds, and the type of benefits it can pay.\nSpouse contribution offset:Â a tax offset of up to $540 may be claimed if you make a contribution to your spouseâ€™s super fund. To receive this offset your spouseâ€™s assessable income plus reportable fringe benefits must be less than $13,800 pa, with the full $540 offset payable if you contribute $3,000 and your spouse earns less than $10,800 pa.\nSuperannuation:Â money that you and your employer put aside in a concessionally taxed trust fund during your working life for you to use when you retire.\nSuperannuation fund:Â a concessionally taxed trust fund created to accept the investment of superannuation savings and contributions. A super fund can be operated by an employer as a corporate fund, by a fund manager as a personal fund, as an industry fund, or it can be self-managed.\nSuper Choice:Â legislation that enablesÂ many, but not all, employees to choose the super fund into which their employer makes compulsory contributions.\nTax file number (TFN):Â a unique identifying number issued to each taxpayer by the Australian Taxation Office.\nTax Offset:Â also known as a tax rebate. Tax offsets directly reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. They are different from deductions, which reduce your total assessable income and therefore your tax by your marginal tax rate. Each dollar of tax offset reduces your tax payable by a dollar regardless of your taxable income.\nWill:Â a legal document that sets out how you wish your assets to be distributed when you die.\nWork test:Â if you are aged between 65 and 74, you must meet the work test to be allowed to make some super contributions. This work test requires you to have worked at least 40 hours within 30 consecutive days in a financial year prior to making the contribution. Generally, a super fund cannot accept super contributions when you reach age 75.\nHow To Turn Your Superannuation Into A Goldmine\n5 Simple Steps to S.U.P.E.R.

    "text": "HOW DO \nI KNOW IF\nPREACHING\nIS FOR ME?\nCHRISTOPHER ASH H\nO WD OIK N O Wthat Christ has called me to â€˜prayer\nand the ministry of the wordâ€™? How can I be sure? \nI canâ€™t. Not with the certainty for which I crave.\n(And if I think I can, I am probably self-deceived.) Rather,\nGod gives us wisdom by his Spirit to know his character and\ngeneral will (Colossians 1:9). And he gives us freedom to\nexercise that wisdom in making our choices. It is a mark of\nimmaturity to expect to be told what to do in some more\nimmediate way. And so articles on guidance are always dis-\nappointing; because God is more concerned with our\ngodliness than our guidance.\nJESUS BUILDS HIS CHURCH BY\nGIVING GIFTS TO HIS PEOPLE\nSo, rather than start with ourselves, let us begin with the Lord Jesus\nChrist. He has promised to build his church (Matthew 16:18). He has\ndied for her (Ephesians 5:25f), been raised, and has ascended as the victor\nover â€˜him who has the power of deathâ€™ (Hebrews 2:14). As the ascended\nconqueror he distributes his varied victory gifts to all his people \n(Ephesians 4:7f), in order that his church shall be built up (1 Corinthians\n12:7; 14:5; Ephesians 4:11-16). Every gift is needed, and no Christian is to\ndespise any gift and think it useless (1 Corinthians 12:12-31). But we\nneed to understand the distinct contribution to the church made by what\nwe call â€˜wordâ€™ gifts.\nâ€˜Wordâ€™ gifts begin with the apostles and prophets of the New Testa-\nment age, who are at the foundation of the church (Ephesians 2:20; 3:5).\nWe have their unique and unchangeable testimony to the Lord Jesus in\nthe New Testament. And then there are the ongoing â€˜wordâ€™ gifts, the\nevangelists (those who spread the good news, both to Christian and non-\nChristian), the pastors and teachers, who care for and lead Godâ€™s church\nby preaching and teaching (Ephesians 4:11f). These are the equipping\nHOW DO I KNOW\n2 gifts; they equip all Christians to do the work of ministry with their own\ngifts, so that the church will be built up. So these â€˜wordâ€™ gifts have a \nspecial place in the Lordâ€™s church-building strategy. For without them\nother Christians will not be equipped for their ministries.\nWE MUST USE THE GIFTS HE GIVES US\nFOR THE BUILDING OF HIS CHURCH\nThe most important principle to bear in mind here is very simple. It is\nthe principle of stewardship. When the Lord Jesus has given us a gift, we\nmust use it to build up his church (Romans 12:6; 1 Corinthians 12:7).\nThis principle applies to all Christians, including those gifted as evangel-\nists, pastors and teachers. On the last day, the Lord Jesus will ask us,\nâ€œWhat use did you make of the gifts I gave you?â€ (cf. the principle in the\nparable of the talents, Matthew 25:14-30). This principle of stewardship\nis very important. So the question is not, â€œWhat do I want to do?â€ but\nrather, â€œWhat am I gifted to do?â€ As sinners we often want to do what we\nought not to do, and we shy from doing what we ought to do.\nThere is little in scripture explicitly about the feelings or desires of the\npeople set apart for word ministry. When Paul speaks of those who\naspire to the pastoral oï¬ƒce (1 Timothy 3:1) he does not make it clear\nwhether the candidates coming forward in Ephesus were to be encour-\naged or discouraged in their desire.\nOn the one hand, some desire to enter this ministry, and ought not \nto. They may for example have a wrong understanding of scripture \n(eg 1 Timothy 1:7), a love of power (1 Peter 5:3) or prominence (3 John 9),\na love of money (1 Timothy 6:5), or a desire to exploit vulnerable people\nby making them dependent upon them (2 Timothy 3:6f).\nOn the other hand, some want to avoid this ministry who ought to be\nin it. For pastoral ministry has its peculiar pressures. And so a love for\nthe world (2 Timothy 4:10; 1 John 2:15-17) or a desire to avoid suï¬€ering \n(2 Timothy 1:6-12; cf. 1 Timothy 4:14) will make us avoid this work, even\nwhen we are called to it. So we must be deeply sceptical of our feelings\nand desires. For it is possible to quench the Spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:19).\nSo, rather than rely on our feelings, we do well to focus on the princi-\nples of stewardship. If Christ has given us â€˜wordâ€™ gifts, then we must use\nthem, whether or not we want to. So the question resolves itself into ask-\nIF PREACHING IS FOR ME?\n3 ing: how will we discern whether we have these gifts? The New Testa-\nment answer may be summed up in three statements.\n1. The gifts of Christ are discerned by the body of\nChrist as they are used by the servants of Christ.\nThe New Testament picture of a healthy church is one in which all\nbelievers are called to ministry (to be servants of Christ and his Church).\nWe are to throw ourselves wholeheartedly into doing what needs to be\ndone. I am not to expect some prior revelation of my gifts, like a bank\nnotiï¬cation of a new PIN number, the envelope arriving secretly from\nheaven, so that I alone can scratch the paper to reveal my unique gift.\nInstead, I am to be an active servant. And as I serve, so the fellowships \nin which I serve will see what I am gifted at and what am no good at. The\nlatter experience may be painful, but is usually a part of the process. \nI remember with some pain having to lead the singing at a school assem-\nbly unaccompanied (because the pianist was absent); it became rapidly\nevident this was not my gift! We do not want â€˜prima donnasâ€™ who \nwill not volunteer to help, because â€˜this is not my giftâ€™ . Rather we want \nservants who will have a go. So, if you are asked to help in some form \nof Christian service, say yes if you possibly can. Have a go. And as you \ndo, your brothers and sisters will tell you what you are gifted at and \nwhat you are not. They will help us â€˜think with sober judgementâ€™ about\nourselves (Romans 12:3).\nIn particular, if you have opportunities to teach the bible, to lead a\nbible study, to give a talk at a summer venture or camp, or to preach in\nchurch, take these opportunities. Ask a mature Christian friend to watch\nand listen critically and to give you (in love!) some honest feedback. Not\nto crush you (if you did badly) or ï¬‚atter you (if you did well), but to help\nyou see whether you have in bud a gift for bible teaching.\nIncidentally, let us beware of replacing â€˜giftsâ€™ with â€˜strategyâ€™ in our\nthinking. We love to plan our lives, to ask and answer the question,\nâ€œWhere will I be of most use to Christ?â€ It is a ï¬ne question. But only the\nLord knows the answer. And it is probably not the answer of our strate-\ngising, in which we are in control. We like to plan a life of maximal\nâ€˜eï¬€ectivenessâ€™; but this is not in our power.\nHOW DO I KNOW\n4 2. Church leaders should appoint to word ministries\nthose in whom they recognise word gifts\nLeaders are better equipped than we to recognise the gifts and calling of\nGod. They watch our characters, listen to our teaching, see how we relate\nto others and how we respond under pressure. This is why the responsi-\nbility for the leaders of the future lies with the leaders of the present. Paul\nwas subjectively convinced of his call by Christ to be an apostle, and \nthe collective leadership of the church recognised this particular grace\ngiven to him, to be the apostle to the gentiles (Galatians 2:8f). The leader-\nship in Antioch heard and recognised the call of Christ by his Spirit to\nSaul and Barnabas to cross-cultural mission (Acts 13:1-3). They in turn\nappointed elders (Acts 14:23), as did Titus in Crete later (Titus 1:5). Paul\nand the collective eldership recognised the gift in Timothy; when they\nlaid hands on him they did not confer gifts upon him (as if they were \nthe priestly purveyors of grace) but rather recognised the gifting of the\nLord Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 4:14; 2 Timothy 1:6). And then Timothy in\nhis turn is to look out for faithful people to whom he can entrust the\nmessage (2 Timothy 2:2).\nAs Christian leaders seek the next generation of ministers of the\nword, they will look for four qualities:\n(i) A godly character They will look ï¬rst for men and women of godly\ncharacter. â€œIf anyone aspires to the oï¬ƒce of overseer, he desires a\nnoble task. Therefore an overseer must beâ€¦â€ (1 Timothy 3:1ï¬€). The\nlogic of the â€˜thereforeâ€™ is that because this is a noble task, the qualiï¬-\ncations for it must be rigorously maintained. The â€˜checklistsâ€™ in \n1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9 are overwhelmingly moral. Others\nwill judge this better than us. For if we think we are godly, it is a sure\nsign we are not. Rather, their judgement will need to overcome our\nown reluctance (cf. James 3:1-12).\n(ii) A clear Gospel Allied with godly character they will look for a clear\nand tenacious grasp of the gospel of the Lord Jesus. We must have a\nclear grasp of  this message. But it is not enough to understand it. To\nbe a pastor, we must hold to it tenaciously, be willing not only \nto teach it positively but also to correct those who teach in error\n(Titus 1:9). We must be prepared to face opposition and suï¬€er for the\nname of the Lord Jesus (2 Timothy 1:1-2:13).\nIF PREACHING IS FOR ME?\n5 (iii) The ability to teach Twice in the pastoral letters one quality \nis mentioned that stands out from the rest: the ability to teach \n(1 Timothy 3:2; 2 Timothy 2:24). The same quality is implied in Titus\n1:9 where the elder â€˜must be able to give instruction in sound doc-\ntrine and also to rebuke those who contradict itâ€™ .\nThe other qualities listed ought to be true of every Christian. But\nnot this one. A deeply godly believer may not have this ability. And\nyet without this ability it is disastrous for someone to enter pastoral\nministry. For this is the ministry of the word, and therefore suitable\nonly for those who can understand and handle words. So when we\ninterview candidates for the Cornhill Training Course we look for\nsome evidence of an ability to teach the bible. Often this gifting is\nonly evident in bud; but it must be there.\n(iv) A love for people Lastly, they will look for a love for people. For\nteaching is more than explanation. It is relational, just as Godâ€™s\nrevealed truth is the relational expression of divine love. No teacher\nwill be heard unless he loves the people he teaches. Paul speaks of \nthe ability to teach in the context of a teacher who is gentle when \nprovoked, prayerful when opposed, and driven by a longing to win \nhis hearers back to God (2 Timothy 2:14-26). Without this love for\npeople, the clearest and cleverest bible scholar in the world is not able\nto teach.\n3. The Path to â€˜Word Ministryâ€™ takes time and testing\nWe live in a very hurried culture. We want to know now what is the call-\ning of Christ for the rest of our lives. But callings to Christian ministry\nare to be tested over time (eg 1 Timothy 3:10 for deacons, and 5:22 for\nelders). The main reason for this is that character only becomes evident\nover time. A church leader who lays hands on someone in haste will\noften have to repent at leisure (1 Timothy 5:22).\nThere are a number of ways in which someone can â€˜put a toe in the\nwaterâ€™ of Bible-teaching ministry, and the Cornhill Training Courses are\nprobably the best known of these. If you think Christ may have gifted you\nfor word ministry, why not investigate a Cornhill course?\nAlthough we have seen that our desires are an unreliable indicator of\nChristâ€™s gifts, nevertheless you will expect to ï¬nd in your heart some\nHOW DO I KNOW\n6 Spirit-given echo of the heart longing of the Lord Jesus for his sheep\n(Matthew 9:36; John 21:15-17). We must expect that the desire of church\nleaders to set you apart for this work will be answered by a willingness in\nyour heart to be appointed. For this ministry must be done from a willing\nheart. It is not to be done â€˜under compulsion, but willingly, as God would\nhave you (do it)â€™ (1 Peter 5:2). I may or may not want to do it, in the shal-\nlow sense that I may want to go on a Caribbean holiday, to give me\npleasure, self-fulï¬lment and delight. But I must be willing to do it. \nThere is perhaps an analogy with the comparison between a western\nmarriage in which the bridegroom chooses the bride, and some cultures\nin which the parents arrange the marriage. In each case the critical point\nis that, however the bridegroom comes face to face with the bride, he\nmust consent to marry her. It does not in the last analysis matter whether\nhe himself has taken the initiative to propose to her, or his parents have\nnegotiated the match. What matters is that he is willing, he consents to\nmarry her (and of course, she him!) So with pastoral ministry. It doesnâ€™t\nmatter whether the initiative began with me, or began with church lead-\ners. In the end, I must be willing to serve in this way.\nCONCLUSION: YOU ARE\nFREE TO DECIDE!\nFinally, remember wisdom and freedom. You are free as a Christian to\nmake your own decisions with the wisdom God gives you. You must nei-\nther let yourself be pressured into pastoral ministry by pushy leaders nor\ndissuaded by worldly motives. You must decide. It is before your own\nMaster you stand or fall; and he is able to make you stand. The rest of us\nwill not sit in judgement upon your decision. No principles in this chap-\nter will make your decision for you. You decide; and as you decide, the\nLord Jesus Christ is working out his purposes, fulï¬lling his promise to\nbuild his church. And so the glory will be his alone.\nThis article is a revised version of a chapter in Workers for the Harvest Field\npublished by 9:38/The Good Book Company, ISBN: 9781905564309.\nAvailable from www.thegoodbook.co.uk price Â£8.00.\nIF PREACHING IS FOR ME?\n7 Â© 2007 THE PROCLAMATION TRUST \nWILLCOX HOUSE 140ïšº148 BOROUGH HIGH ST REET LONDON SE1 1LB ",

    "text": "home\nour grove\nharvesting\nnews\nmanagement team\nour oil\ncontact us\nÂ \nIn 2013, we anticipate yielding 350,000 litres of  Single-Estate Extra Virgin Olive Oil from our orchard, comprising nearly 75,000  trees.Â \nThe Coonalpyn Olives Project, which is located in the  southern part of the optimum zone for olive production in Australia, has been  producing and selling Extra Virgin Olive Oil since 2004 to several leading  Australian Brands.\nHealth Benefits:\nOlive oil is high in monounsaturated fat and is a good  source of antioxidants. It appears that various levels of total fat (where the  fat was mostly olive oil) can been associated with the excellent health (low  levels of chronic diseases and high adult life expectancy) seen in the  Mediterranean region for hundreds of years.\nThe consumption of large amounts of vegetables and legumes  in much of the Mediterranean region is made easier by the concomitant use of  liberal amounts of olive oil, which enhances the taste and increases the energy  density of these foods.\nRespected health expert Rosemary Stanton OAM PhD APD  believes there are common features of some Mediterranean diets, which appear to  be protective against cardio vascular disease, type 2 diabetes and some  cancers. These protective elements include a predominance of vegetables,  fruits, grains, fish, nuts and olive oil, with only small quantities of red  meat, sugar and highly processed foods.\nThe health benefits of olive oil continues to create new and  growing markets amongst the health conscious consumer, and this trend is  expected to continue in both the Asian and Western cultures.\nOur olive varieties and their origins:\nThe olive varieties have been selected because they suit the  conditions at Coonalpyn and also because they are well established mainstream  varieties grown in other olive producing countries. The descriptions below are  taken from the IOOC publication World Catalogue of Olive Varieties (2000) and  also from what is known about olive variety importation into Australia.\nPicual:\nPicual is the main Spanish olive oil variety. This variety  was imported into Australia from Spain by the Victorian Department of  Agriculture in the 1960s. Picual is easier to harvest than some other Spanish  varieties. Picual performs well at Coonalpyn and most other olive orchards in  the region and is one of the main varieties. The oil has a particular taste  that ideally blends with other varieties such as Barnea.\nBarnea:\nBarnea is an established major variety in Israel. It is also  grown in other middle-eastern countries and in New Zealand and the USA. The  Barnea variety was selected as a seedling tree in the Barnea Kadesh region of  Israel and named after the region where it was found. This conventional olive  selection program has been run since the 1970s by the Volcani Institute in  Israel.Â \nBarnea was imported into Australia in the mid 1990s from the  Volcani Institute in Israel under a special arrangement with the Australian  government because the variety had the potential to suit Australian conditions  and is easier to harvest than many other olive varieties.\nBarnea needs careful horticultural management but suits the  climate at Coonalpyn. Barnea olives produce mildly flavoured but well-balanced  olive oil that is the basis for most high quality blended oils in Australia.  The Barnea variety is also being used in organic olive orchards because of its  natural resistance to olive fungus diseases.\nFrantoio:Â \nFrantoio is a major Italian variety grown in the colder  parts of Italy. The variety has been imported into Australia through several  departments of Agriculture. We believe that the trees at Coonalpyn came from  trees grown by the SA Department of Agriculture.\nAt Coonalpyn Frantoio olives produce well coloured and  flavoursome oil that is used in small quantities to add some mild but  traditional olive flavours to blends.\nLeccino:\nThis is another traditional Italian variety imported through  the same means as Frantoio that has milder flavour than Frantoio but is used  for similar purposes. Some customers of Coonalpyn Olives purchase the Leccino  for specific blends.\nManzanillo:Â \nManzanillo is a major Spanish variety used to make olive oil  and also to make table olives. The variety has been in Australia since the  early 1900s and the trees at Coonalpyn came from nurseries that had access to  several sources of Manzanillo. At Coonalpyn this variety is grown in small  numbers of trees to provide pollen for the flowers of the other varieties. The  Manzanillo oil from Coonalpyn has a unique fruity flavour that is sought by  specialist oil blenders\nÂ \nÂ \nÂ \nÂ \n",

The following is a quick guide that can help you make the right decisions.\nUse a current prescription\nPrescriptions do not always remain the same. Over time, your optometrist may alter your prescription based his updated evaluation of your eyes. Prescriptions are constantly changed to address any new problems or compliment any progress.\nDo not place an order with a dated prescription.  Use your most recent prescription when ordering online. If you have misplaced this, consider approaching your optometrist for a replacement. Check the date of your prescription. If it\u0027s older than 12 months, you may want to consider getting any new one.\nYour prescription will include your\nName\nPrescription expiration date\nName and contact details of the prescriber\nPower for the lens\nBase curve\nMaterial\nExamination date\nDiameter\nThe name of the brand/manufacturer.\nCheck your Order Twice before submitting it\nTake your time before making your order. Don\u0027t be quick to make a decision. Before you click the submit button, ensure that the contact lens that you are buying fits with your prescription. Pay attention to the lettering. It is important that you choose the right fit for your eyes or this may lead to long term complications. Correcting your order may also extend the processing period which will delay your delivery.\nDiscuss with your Optometrist about Substitute lens\nContact lenses Online is stocked with dozens of different brands (International and Australian). On rare instances, we may not have the particular brand that you are searching for in stock. But you are likely to find an equally suitable alternative. If you are unsure about the proffered substitute, consult with your optometrist. Your doctor will be able to suggest alternative brands that will still fit with your prescription.\nCheck the expiration date on the package.\nAll our contact lenses are sold within their outlined lifetime. Using dated lenses may damage your eye. Check your package when it is delivered. If you should receive a delivery with an expired date, return it immediately and we will immediately send a replacement.\nCheck the Product\nBefore you unpack the contact lens and put it on, check to make sure that your order is the right one and fits with your need. Your package should be the brand you ordered with the exact name and sphere. Other details include the base curve, diameter and cylinder. If your package is the wrong one, please return it immediately for a replacement. It is risky to use contact lenses that do not match your prescription.\nDon\u0027t skip your regular eye examination\nContact lenses online offers high quality vision correction solutions. But that doesn\u0027t mean that you no longer need an eye examination. Do not skip your annual or bi-annual eye examination. This will ensure that you are always using the best possible setting for your needs. As your eyesight improves, your doctor may alter your prescription to enhance the corrective factor. Regular visits will also ensure that your eyes aren\u0027t being overly strained with regular use or infected.\nContact Lenses Online: Beyond Your Order\nContact Lenses can be used to safely correct vision. But only if they are used the right way. Make sure that you buy contact lenses for the right reasons. It is the only way of guaranteeing that your eyes remain healthy.\nBefore buying your contact lens, it is advised that you go for an eye examination. The results of the eye exam can be used to determine if you are a right candidate for contact lenses and which lens is the right fit for your needs. Your optometrist will provide you with the right measurements for your contact lens and will also offer assistance and advice on how you can take proper care of them.\nContact Lenses: Things you should know\nWhy do you need a Prescription? Contact lenses are not toys. Wearing contact lenses without a proper prescription fitted by your optometrist can be harmful to your eyes.   Poorly fitted lens or contact lenses made from the wrong kind of material can very easily damage your eyes. It increases your risk of infection and could lead to permanent tissue damage.\nDiscussing with an optometrist will also make it easier choosing the right contact lens. Contact Lenses online is home to a vast selection of lenses. Making the right decision can be overwhelming if you aren\u0027t already familiar with the different options. Learning more about contact lenses and the different materials that they are made from can help you make the right decision. For instance, some contact lenses are designed to be replaced while others can be worn for extended periods. You\u0027ll also find decorative contact lenses and silicone hydrogel lenses among other options.\nHow to Care for your Contact Lens: Quick Tips\nYour package has arrived and you\u0027re the proud new owner of a new set of contact lenses. Now what? The following will help you get the best out of your new purchase.\nAlways follow the product instructions or those of your optometrist when cleaning your contact lens. Rinse your contact lens carefully before soaking it in cleaning solution. Ensure that the lens is completely covered.\nDo not swim or enter a hot tub while wearing your contact lenses. Follow the use and replacement guidelines recommended by your physician.\nNever attempt to clean your lens by putting it in your mouth. Saliva is not an acceptable cleaning solution. Doing this will only expose you to a possible infection.\nDo not use product that have not been recommended by your optometrist to disinfect and clean your contact lenses. Always clean your contact lenses with fresh solution. Do not re-use old solution as this will increase you risk of catching an infection.\nKeep your hands clean and dry before handling your contact lens. Change your contact lens solution everyday even if you only use your contact lenses periodically.\nAbove all, it is important to remember that your contact lenses are medical tools and need to be treated with the right amount of care. Use your contact lenses carefully. Wearing your contact lens for extended lengths may lead to redness, sore eyes or blurry vision.\nDo not share your contact lens with other people. This includes prescribed contact lenses and colored lenses used for cosmetic ends.\nMore contact lens care tips can be found here and here .\nNo two people have the same eyes and so the contact lenses which is best for someone else may not be the best for you. For the latest information regarding this you should visit your optometrist or eyecare professional.\nContact Lenses\nFaq\nTerms \u0026 Conditions\nHealth Funds\nPrivacy\nContact Us\nAbout Us\nArticles\nBlog\nLinks\nContact Lenses Online is to be used as a contact lens replacement service only.

    "text": "Â \nÂ \nTFT Services\nTFT - Thought Field Therapy\nNLP - Neuro-Linguistic Programming\nThought Field Therapy\nTFT represents a revolutionary advance in the way psychological disturbances are perceived and managed. Tens of thousands of people worldwide have used TFT to conquer their fears, eliminate compulsions, recover from stress and anxiety, put an end to procrastination and quiet their anger and grief. It provides them with emotional renewal, rapidly, safely and without long-term psychotherapy and without medication.\nIn todayâ€™s society too many people become reliant on both prescribed and un-prescribed drugs to cope with whatever issues or traumas they are attempting to deal with. They tend not to seek effective long term health methods because they want relief from the emotions or feelings they are having instantly. If they canâ€™t sleep, they take sleeping tablets, if they are tired and drained they have a coffee or a red bull, if they are diagnosed with a form of depression, they take anti-depressants.\nTFT is a system that accesses and resolves the essence and the root cause of your problem, whether it is stress, anxiety, anger, low self-esteem, guilt or grief. It addresses individualâ€™s fundamental causes for stress, providing information in the form of a healing code, engaging the bodyâ€™s natural healing system, to resolve emotion disturbances and psychological issues. There are no risks, there are no side effects, TFT is different from any other psychological treatment than you have ever used and thanks to new research using technology that can monitor the bodyâ€™s autonomic nervous system, we can now scientifically measure and quantify the systemic changes that TFT produces. Meaning that all results are guaranteed.\nÂ \nWebsite design by Concept Marketing\nCopyright Â© 2010 Corporate Clarity\nÂ \n",

There are two closely related species of Corroboree Frog:\nThe Southern Corroboree Frog (Pseudophryne corroboree)\nThe Northern Corroboree Frog (Pseudophryne pengilleyei)\nBoth Corroboree Frog species are between 2.5 and 3 centimetres in length.\nWhere Do The Corroboree Frogs Live?\nCorroboree Frogs are only found in a small area of south-eastern New South Wales.\nThe distribution of the Southern Corroboree Frog (P corroboree) and the Northern Corroboree Frog (P. pengilleyi). Darker stippling indicates the range of each species.\nBoth species occur in high montane and sub-alpine habitats. The Southern Corroboree Frog only occurs in the Snowy Mountains region of Kosciuszko National Park between 1250 and 1750 meters above sea level. The Northern Corroboree Frog occurs in two areas; the Fiery Range region of Kosciuszko National Park and nearby State Forests, and the Brindabella Ranges within Namadgi National Park, Bimberi Nature Reserve and Brindabella National Park. Northern Corroboree Frogs range from between 950 and 1800 meters above sea level.\nWhat Habitats Do Corroboree Frogs Use?\nDuring the breeding season Corroboree Frogs live in pools within sphagnum bogs, wet tussock grasslands, and wet heath.\nTypical sub-alpine sphagnum bog pool used as breeding habitat for the Southern Corrobore Frog and high altitude populations of the Northern Corroboree Frog.\nHigh-montane wet-tussock grassland area typical of the breeding habitat used by many Northern Corroboree Frog populations.\nCorroboree Frogs generally prefer shallow pools with low water flow and a large surface area. These pools often dry during mid summer which puts the Corroboree Frog tadpoles at risk during drought years, as the pools may dry before they can change into young frogs. However the advantage of pools that dry each year is that they usually have much lower densities of tadpole predators, such as fish and dragonfly larvae.\nVery little is known about the non-breeding habitats used by Corroboree Frogs. Corroboree Frogs have been found under logs and leaf litter in woodlands surrounding breeding habitat so it is likely that they move out of the pools and spend the winter in nearby woodlands.\nWhat Do Corroboree Frogs Eat?\nCorroboree Frogs mainly eat small ants and other invertebrates. During winter they eat much less and many individuals donâ€™t appear to eat at all.\nWhat Is The Corroboree Frog Life-Cycle?\nThe breeding season for Corroboree Frogs is during summer, from mid January through to the end of February. The males call from nest sites within thick vegetation at the edges of pools. Female Corroboree Frogs are attracted to their calls and lay their eggs within the maleâ€™s nest. After they have laid their eggs the female leaves the male to look after the eggs. A single female usually lays between 10 and 40 eggs in a clutch.\nThe male may attract several females to lay eggs in their nest throughout the breeding season and up to 200 eggs have been recorded in the one nest.\nAt the end of the breeding season the male leaves his nest and the eggs are left develop through to hatching. Once the eggs have reached hatching stage they stop developing and wait for rains in autumn and winter to flood the nest site. Once the nest is flooded the eggs then hatch into tadpoles. The tadpoles move through the vegetation into the main pool where they grow and develop until the following summer when they transform into little Corroboree Frogs.\nFrom egg laying to transformation takes between 10 and 11 months in the wild and it is another four years before the Corroboree Frogs reaches sexual maturity and are able to breed themselves and repeat the life-cycle.\nÂ \nHome\nDonate\nCorroboree Frog\nCorroboree Conservation\nCaptive Breeding\nShow Your Support\nMore Information\nNews \u0026 Updates\nIn The Media\nContact Us\n",

Each includes an on/off button and a built in loudspeaker and these Conference Microphones solve the problems of noise and feedback that exist with conventional microphones.\nOur Conference Microphones have a chairman override function. The chairman can press their override button which temporarily mutes all other microphones.\nThese Conference microphones are used for any interactive discussion, in a boardroom application or a much larger conference with 200+ people all wanting to make a contribution. They have been used for Trade Negotiations, Union Meetings, International Treaty Negotiations, Training Meetings, the applications are endless, and in fact anywhere where everyone has the possibility to be heard.\nMicrophone Choices\nWireless Conference Microphone\nDCN NG Discussion â€“ Wireless.

Our conference microphones are turned on by the presenter; this also eliminates the possibility of any embarrasing asides being heard by the audience.\nConference Microphones are ideally suited to work with simultaneous interpretation systems. These Conference Microphones are also ideal in either Plenary or breakout areas.\nThe Conference Microphones come as either Wired or Wireless Conference Microphones.

Since that moment, Make-A-Wish Australia has granted almost 7,000 wishes to Australian children with life-threatening medical conditions.\nThe first Australian wish was grantedÂ to 16-year-old Shawn Cleland of FootscrayÂ in Melbourne in 1985. An avid fan of what was then the VFL, Shawnâ€™s wish was to meet the players of his beloved Footscray Football Club.\nShawn had never flown in a plane â€“ so Make-A-Wish added an extra-special touch, flying Shawn to Sydney to see the Bulldogs play the Swans.\nShawnâ€™s favourite player, Footscray legend, Simon Beasley, paid him a visit before the game, â€˜Tell the team that if they get a thrashing they deserve a salary cutâ€™, Shawn joked.\nMake-A-Wish Australia is a non-profit organisation and is an affiliate of Make-A-Wish International. Make-A-Wish organisations can now be found in 36 countries across the globe.\nA recent survey found that Make-A-Wish wishes have a significantÂ positive impact on the health and wellbeing of wish children.Â  97 percent of parents surveyed observed a â€˜noticeable improvementâ€™ in their childâ€™s mental and emotional health following theÂ granting of their wish and said physical health improved discernibly in as many as 75 percent of cases.\nMake-A-Wish receives no ongoing government funding and is critically reliant on the generous support of individuals, organisations and fundraising initiatives like the Kilimanjaro Charity Challenge.\nFor further information regarding Make-A-Wish Australia, please call 1800 032 260 or visit: www.makeawish.org.au\nÂ \nÂ \nThe Childrenâ€™s Hospital at WestmeadÂ is the largest, highly respected paediatricÂ centre in NSW, providing excellent care for children from NSW, Australia and across the Pacific Rim. Established in 1880, a stand alone public Hospital and registered charity, The Childrenâ€™s Hospital at WestmeadÂ serves over 50,000 admitted sick children and their families each year in a family-focused healing environment.\nPeople sayÂ what courage we have to be climbing some of the highest and most dangerous mountains around the world, but we would disagree.\nThe real courage is in the hearts and souls of the young children that face daily battles with sickness and injury in their lives at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital at Westmead. Many of the children who are admitted with sickness or injury face fear, uncertainty, stress and unwelcome pain, so who are the real heroes?\nPlease help us support the Childrenâ€™s Hospital at WestmeadÂ so we can make a difference in these childrenâ€™s lives â€“ they are our future and deserve our help.\nThe Childrenâ€™s Hospital at Westmead website: www.chw.edu.au\nA promise was madeÂ to a dying soldier in the trenches of WWI.

    "text": "Blog\nOnline Contests\nHome\nOnline Competitions\nAustralian Competitions\nWin A House\nWin A Car\nWin Money\nFree Competitions â€“ Help Yourself And The Company Involved\nOne way that companies today bring in new business is through free competitions. Australia is just one of the many countries around the world where this selling tactic has been proven successful. You can win all sorts of things, from simple, everyday stuff such as magazines and make up to high-end, big ticket items like a new camera or laptop. The reason why this has been the case is easy to figure out. People love winning stuff for free, and there is nothing better than just waiting for the item in question to show up at your doorstep. If you want to take a new approach in bringing in new customers, giving free stuff is one sure way of attracting them.\nFree Competitions\nFree Competitions â€“ Giving away free stuff will get you a lot of website traffic\nWhen you advertise a giveaway contest on your website, you will immediately attract the attention of contest seekers. This results in creating awareness about your site among these first-time visitors. In return, they will remember your product or service, and easily return to it whenever they are in need. Offering freebies Australia wide is a great marketing tool.\nFree Competitions â€“ Build an opt-in list for your site\nMost websites that promote free competitions will ask you to sign up for their articles or newsletters. You can always unsubscribe yourself from these at any given time. There are those websites, however, that sometimes have this as an option. You can easily tell which websites these are by the additional check box at the end of the entry form.\nDepending on how you promote your contest, you can create a list of 500 to 1000 people or more that will allow you to run an effective competition campaign. Most countries have local websites that catalogue competitions which allow you to place your ads free of charge or sometimes for a small advertising fee. Even though you may have to spend a little, you will still be able increase your market reach and attract more visitors to your site in the process.\nFree Competitions â€“ Consider what you plan as a giveaway\nThis is something that you should plan for carefully when running free competitions. If your website sells laptop computers and you are planning on giving one away, this might remove some potential business opportunities from your company. A person who stands to win a laptop for free would rather take that chance rather than spend his money purchasing it. It may be better to give them the opportunity to win a car or win a house or if that is going to give a poor return then the opportunity to win money is always a draw card.\nFor more information about free competitions see Competitions Australia\nWin A House Survey\nLet us know how much you would pay for a ticket to win a $500,000 House\nPlease select\nOther Amount\nOther pizes you would like to win?\nÂ \ncforms contact form by delicious:days\nCompetitions Australia\nCopyright Â© 2013 All Rights Reserved\nWebsite Creation: Fruitful Online .\nPrivacy Policy | Sitemap | About Us\nWin A Car | Win Money | Win A House\n",

    "text": "What is in our dog food?\nPublished on Sunday, 24 June 2012 00:32 |\n| Hits: 1935\nNutritional Benefits of The Complete Meal for DogsÂ©\nÂ \nWhat are Vitamins and Minerals?Â \nVitamins and Minerals make bodies work properly.\nSome foods have more vitamins and minerals than others.\nÂ \nWhat do Vitamins and Minerals Do?\nVitamins and Minerals boost the immune system, support normal growth and development which help cells and organs do the job they are designed to do.\nÂ \nWhatâ€™s in our Food?\nÂ \nMeat and Bone:\nOrganic Meat and Bone should be the greater part of the canines meal.Â \nOrganic Meat, which is high in amino acids, is an excellent protein source.Â \nAmino acids determine how much protein can be used by the body.\nIt is the source of high quality protein that is vital to build new cells, repair damaged tissue and general maintenance of the body.Â \nWithout good quality protein the body cannot function well and muscle will suffer.\nBones are an integral part in dental hygiene and contain bone marrow and cartilage.\nOrganic meat is a good source of Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids.\nÂ \nVitamins:\nB1: Thiamine helps the body convert carbohydrates into energy and is necessary for the heart, muscle and nervous system to function properly.\nB2: Riboflavin is essential for turning carbohydrates into energy and producing red blood cells. It is also important for vision.\nB3: Niacin helps the body turn food into energy, it helps maintain healthy skin and is important for nerve function.\nB6: Is important for the normal brain and nerve function. It also helps the body break down proteins and make red blood cells.\nB12: Helps make red blood cells and is important for nerve cell function.\nÂ \nMinerals:\nCalcium: Essential for building strong bones and teeth.\nIron: Helps the red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the body.Â Anemia and fatigue can be symptoms of lack of iron.\nPhosphorus: Helps form healthy bones and teeth.Â It also helps the body make energy. It is part of every cell membrane and every cell in the body needs phosphorus to function normally.\nZinc: Is important for normal growth, strong immunity and wound healing.\nÂ \nEssential Fatty Acids:\nOmega-3 fatty acids: are considered essential for the body, and must be derived from the foods we eat. They are needed to for the body to function normally. They have a number of health benefits including reducing inflammation in the blood vessels and joints, they are beneficial to cardiovascular and brain health. Organic and free-range animals have much higher levels of Omega-3s than typical grain-fed animals.\nOmega-6 fatty acids: are also essential for the body and they play an important role in cell growth, brain developlment and muscle development. The Omega-6s play a critical role in the production of hormones and in the nervous system as a transmitter of nerve impulses.\nÂ \nFarm Fresh, Seasonal Fruit and Vegetables:\nSoluble fibre:\nSoluble fibre soaks up water like a sponge, which helps to plump out the faeces and allows it to pass through the gut more easily. It acts to slow down the rate of digestion. (Fruit and Vegetables)\nInsoluble fibre:\nInsoluble fibre doesn\u0027t absorb water and speeds up the time that food passes through the gut. (The skin of fruit and vegetables)\nÂ \nVitamins:\nA: Prevents eye problems and promotes a healthy immune system, it is essential for the growth of and development of cells and keeps skin healthy.\nC: Essential for healthy bones, teeth, gums and blood vessels. It helps absorb iron and calcium, aids in wound healing and helps brain function.\nE: Antioxidant and helps protect cells from damage. It is very important for the health of red blood cells.\nB6: Is important for the normal brain and nerve function. It also helps the body break down proteins and make red blood cells.\nB2: Riboflavin is essential for turning carbohydrates into energy and producing red blood cells. It is also important for vision.\nB9: Folic acid helps make red blood cells.\nÂ \nMinerals:\nCalcium: Essential for building strong bones and teeth.\nIron: Helps the red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the body. Anemia and fatigue can be symptoms of lack of iron.\nMagnesium: Helps muscle and nerve function. Keeps bones strong, helps the body create energy and make protein.\nPotassium: Helps with muscle and nervous system function. It also helps the body maintain the balance of water in the blood and body tissue.\nÂ \nThe extras that make a â€œComplete Mealâ€\nAustralian Bush Honey:\nContains antibacterial Properties.\nGreat nerve tonic.\nHeart tonic and energizer.\nImmune booster.\nÂ \nChia Seeds:\nOmega-3, Protein, Calcium, Fibre and Iron\nOmega-3 fatty acids are also known as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and considered essential fatty acids\nOmega-3 fatty acids play a crucial role in brain function, as well as normal growth and development.\nResearch shows that omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and may help lower risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer and arthritis.\nDeficiency of omega-3 fatty acid may include fatigue, poor memory, dry skin, heart problems and poor circulation.\nWe use human-grade Australian grown chia seeds from The Chia Co .\nVirgin Coconut Oil\nCoconut oil is a natural, non-toxic oil that doesn\u0027t contain trans fats, which can cause heart disease.Â \nIt contains lauric acid, a compound also found in breast milk, which acts to boost the efficiency of the immune system and protect against disease.\nCoconut oil has antibacterial, antifungal and antiseptic properties and will help a dog\u0027s skin, coat and joints from the inside.\nYou may sometimes see small white chunks in the patties, this is the coconut oil, as it solidifies when below 230.\nNutritional Supplement:\ncontains a powerful electrolyte\nmay boost cardiovascular health\nmay stabilize and regulate the immune system\nmay remove toxins including heavy metals from the body\ncontains chelated technology - coats the ingredients in amino acids for superior absorption\nmay reduce muscle pain from lactic acid\ncontains alkaline minerals which reduce acidosis (grain poisoning)\npowerful antioxidants, cellular protection\noptimal wellbeing\nbio-available nutrients\nfull spectrum vitamins and minerals, botanical extracts, essential fatty acids\nmay provide improved odour control\nmay be a valuable â€˜animal rescue remedyâ€™ during periods of stress, for sick, weak, and/or elderly animals\neconomical\nIngredients\nVitamin A (retinol)\nPowerful antioxidant, essential for normal growth and development and for a healthy immune system.\nVitamin C (ascorbic acid)\nDogs and cats produce their own vitamin C however stress can increase the bodies overall requirements. Vitamin C is used to manufacture collagen, is vital for wound repair, healthy gums, and for structures that support the body such a ligaments, cartilage and tendons. Vitamin C is very important for immune function and is an antioxidant. Vitamin C may be helpful for the treatment of allergies and immune conditions.\nVitamin D (calciferol)\nActively involved in the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus, promotes strong bones.\nVitamin E (alpha-tocopherol)\nAn important fat-soluble vitamin and antioxidant protecting cell membranes against free radical damage, necessary for immune functions and beneficial for protection against a multitude of conditions.\nVitamin K\nBeneficial for heart, bone and skin health, and bloods ability to clot; an extremely important vitamin for the cardiovascular system including veins and arteries.\nVitamin B6 (pyridoxine)Â \nPlays an essential role in protein metabolism and the formation of haemoglobin - the pigment in blood that carries oxygen around the body. Studies have shown that vitamin B6 is required to cure dermatitis. Deficiencies have been linked to anaemia.\nVitamin B12 (cobalamin)\nAÂ water soluble vitamin that plays a key role in many processes of the body. It is essential for good digestion and the absorption of nutrients, for good carbohydrate and fat metabolism, and for synthesis of protein.\nVitamin B9 (folate)\nLiver is a high source of vitamin B9. This vitamin is required for numerous body functions including DNA synthesis and repair, cell division and cellular growth.\nVitamin B2 (riboflavin)\nSupports adrenal function, helps to calm and maintain a healthy nervous system and facilitates key metabolic processes including turning food into energy for the body.Â \nB2 is crucial for helping other B vitamins undergo the chemical changes that make them useful for health.\nVitamin B3 (niacin)\nNecessary for metabolizing carbohydrates, fats and proteins, and for the maintenance of tissues, cell integrity and health. B3 is required for proper digestive function, plays a role in antioxidant and detoxification processes, and in the creation of hormones.\nVitamin B7 (biotin)\nConsidered very beneficial for the growth and health of hair, maintains good skin texture, and keeps the nervous system in a healthy state.\nVitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)Â \nVitamin B5 is found in the blood plasma. It is essential to maintain the bodyâ€™s balance of sodium and potassium, and therefore vital for regulation of body fluids and blood pressure. It is found in all living cells, plant and animal. Vitamin B5 is used in the body by bacterial flora in the intestines. B5 and B2 work together with CoQ10 to synthesis fatty acids.\nIpriflavone\nAlfalfa and propolis are rich in ipriflavone but in most bone support supplements it is man-made from soy; used for preventing and treating weak bones, metabolizing calcium, and increasing bone density.\nCrenic Acid and Apocrenic Acid\nCrenic acid is an organic acid existing in vegetable mould, when exposed to air the oxidation of the crenic acid forms apocrenic acid, which goes brown, giving itâ€™s colour, soluble in water.\nCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)\nAlso called ubiquinone, CoQ10 is related to Vitamin K. CoQ10 naturally occurs in the body and is particularly important in mitochondrial energy synthesis. It acts as a cofactor that creates adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the body\u0027s major source of energy to fuel its biochemical reactions. The benefits of CoQ10 include boosts the immune system especially for chronic disease states, improves inflammation especially gingivitis, and is helpful in heart diseases including cardiomyopathy.\n70 Micronutrients\nMicronutrients are different from macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein and fat) because they are only required in tiny amounts but are still essential for good health. Micronutrients include boron, calcium, chloride, chromium, cobalt, copper, fluoride, iodine, iron, lithium, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium, sulfur and zinc.\n24 Botanical Extracts\nBotanical extracts are processed by scientifically eliminating the non-beneficial parts of a plant, then continually processing it to reach a ratio that shows the amount of actual plant processed vs. the actual amount of the beneficial finished product. As an example, Alfalfa Leaf 4:1 means that four pounds of alfalfa leaves were processed to produce one pound of finished powdered herb. This means that Alfalfa 4:1 is 4 times stronger than the raw herb powder. The botanical extracts are beneficial for optimal wellbeing.\n17 Amino Acids\nThe building blocks of protein; proteins provide structure for all living things, and in various forms it participates in vital chemical processes that sustain life. There are 28 commonly known amino acids. Nine of these are called essential amino acids and cannot be produced by the body. They must be obtained from food or supplements (making them â€˜essentialâ€™). The other 19 can be produced by the body from other amino acids as needed. Amino acids are utilized to make crucial substances in the body including enzymes, hormones, haemoglobin, and antibodies. They have a role in repairing muscles, ligaments, tendons, organs, glands, nails/claws and hair. They also enable vitamins and minerals to carry out their jobs efficiently.\nMarine lipid concentrate\nThis refers to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Omega-3 is found in oil from certain types of fish, vegetables and other plant sources. Marine lipid concentrate is sourced from plants, and studies show benefits for healthy skin and coat, cardiovascular system and heart, muscles and joints.\nOlive Oil\nStudies into the benefits of olive oil on pet health are mixed. There are only a few published studies where pets were fed olive oil for specific health complaints. However, the following results have been recorded - the addition of olive oil in the diet had a positive effect on digestibility when compared to sunflower oil for both dogs and cats, and it may play a beneficial role in feline weight control.\nOrganic Flaxseed OilÂ \nFlaxseed is rich in fibre and omega-3 fatty acids, which we know have beneficial physiological effects. Flaxseed is great for the cardiovascular system because it is the richest source of both ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) and lignans. Lignans are found in the cell walls of plants, and has proven health benefits for human and animal bodies.\nBorage Seed Oil\nHas one of the highest amounts of GLA (linolenic acid) of any seed oils. It is thought to provide therapeutic benefits in cases of rheumatologic illness due to itâ€™s anti-inflammatory effects. It therefore may also have benefits for arthritis, atopic eczema, and respiratory inflammation.Â \nWheatgrass Extract\nWheatgrass is well known as a â€œsuper foodâ€. It has high levels of chlorophyll, flavonoids and other antioxidants, and important micronutrients including vitamins A, C, E, B1, B2, B3, B5 and B6, as well as biotin, folic acid, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, iron and magnesium. Research shows significant benefits for the respiratory system, for eczema, and for women undergoing breast cancer radiation. Wheatgrass is considered one of the most potent natural medicines in the herbal pharmacopeia.\nGarlic\nGarlic is a very well-known beneficial herb, safe for dogs and cats in small doses. Garlic promotes the wellbeing of the heart and immune systems, has antioxidant and antibacterial properties, and helps maintain healthy blood circulation. The active component in garlic is allicin, produced when garlic is chopped, chewed or bruised. It is a powerful antibiotic, a potent agent that helps the body inhibit the ability of germs to grow and reproduce. Garlic also contains germanium, which tests have shown to be an anti-cancer agent. Garlic helps regulate blood pressure, strengthens the bodyâ€™s defenses against allergies, and is known to kill and expel some intestinal parasites.\nParsley Extract\nParsley is often used in herbal medicine for urinary tract infections, kidney stones, gastrointestinal disorders and a whole list of other conditions. Most commonly it is used as a breath freshener. Parsley may also help stimulate appetite and improve overall digestion. Many people are surprised to learn that parsley contains three times more vitamin C (166mg per 100g) than oranges and about the same as blackcurrants. The iron content is also high, 5.5mg per 100g.\nSaw Palmetto\nDerived from the deep purple berries of the saw palmetto fan palm (Serenoa repens), saw palmetto is rich in beneficial fatty acids. This is the most common reason for supplementing with it. Despite some claims that saw palmetto is beneficial in cases of prostate cancer, research trails show inconsistent results. It has however been shown to assist persistent coughs, digestive problems, frequent urination, and urethra blockages.\nAfrican Pygeum\nDerived from the African cherry/plum tree (pygeum africanum). Pygeum is an anti-inflammatory, reduces oedema, and is beneficial for treating bladder discomfort. Studies also show that it may be beneficial for prostate issues.\nPapaya\nPapaya contains papain, an enzyme that helps digest proteins. It is very high in vitamins C and A, rich in antioxidants including carotenes and flavonoids, folate and more. In combination these nutrients may promote the health of the cardiovascular system, provide protection against some cancers, and promote good digestion. Papain is often compared to bromelain, a similar enzyme found in pineapples, and used for inflammation. Papaya has been shown to improve healing from burns.\nBlackberry extract\nAbundant with antioxidants and important vitamins, blackberry extracts helps protect against free radical damage. Studies with blackberry extract have shown an ability to reduce the size of cancerous tumours and prevent the spread of cancer cells in mice.\nSilica\nSilica is an essential requirement for the body, needed by bones, tendons, skin, cartilage, blood vessels, blood and organs. The body is unable to make silica itself so it must be provided through food or supplements. The benefits of silica are extensive. Ask us for a factsheet on silica if you would like more information.\nCalcium\nMost pets that eat raw bones or small whole fish donâ€™t generally require calcium supplementation. Calcium is essential for maintaining healthy bones and teeth, muscle contractions, nerve impulses, and blood coagulation.\nSelenium\nAÂ powerful antioxidant that works with vitamin E to strengthen cells, fight degeneration, and protect the immune system.\nChromium\nA trace mineral; sometimes given for diabetes in cats and dogs because of its links with improving insulin effectiveness.\nMagnesium\nImportant for muscle and nerve activity.\nIodine\nAÂ rich source of iodine is found in kelp; may assist with thyroid problems, acts to calm the body and relieve nervous tension and promotes clear thinking.\nVanadium\nAÂ trace mineral that may be beneficial in the treatment of diabetes.\nBoron\nAÂ mineral that can aid in the absorption of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus from foods. Boron may be helpful in cases of osteoarthritis, fracture healing and obesity.\nManganese\nAn essential trace mineral needed for vital enzyme reactions, healthy bone development and metabolism, joint health and assists in rebuilding cartilage.\nIron\nAs its primary function, iron binds with copper and protein to form haemoglobin, which carries oxygen in red blood cells.\nCopper\nNecessary for the formation of collagen, bone and connective tissue, the absorption of iron, development of red blood cells, the development of hair pigment (coat colour) and it acts as an antioxidant. Some breeds of dogs (Bedlington Terriers, Westies and Dobermans) are sensitive to excess copper so supplementation of products containing copper should be discussed with a vet.\nZinc\nVery important for skin health, supports the immune system, helps fight viral infections, and is recommended for body odour â€“ â€˜if you stink, take zincâ€™.\n",

Ever looked                      at those film stars and wished for a beautiful smile like                      them. Chances are they have been to a cosmetic                      dentist too. An improved smile is not                      just about perfect teeth but also about improved self-image                      and with today\u0027s technology most of these cosmetic procedures                      are pain free due to the different types of sedation                      dentistry available.\nSo                      Flash that beautiful smile and see how many you get back!\nThere are many procedures in cosmetic                      dentistry today. Discuss what is best                      for you with our cosmetic dentist. Letâ€™s talk about the more                      commonly used procedures.\nOne of the most common procedures                      in cosmetic dentistry is tooth whitening . It not only improves                      your smile but also gives your face a healthier appearance.                      You can take instructions from our cosmetic dentist on how                      to whiten your teeth at home using a nite white take home                      kit or you can do the 1 hour in-chair Zoom                      2 Laser Teeth Whitening procedure at either                      the Liverpool or Mascot Surgeries. Generally people love their                      smile and the results of cosmetic dentistry.\nAnother procedure in cosmetic                      dentistry is dental                      veneers . These are thin                      pieces of porcelain that are glued to problem teeth. Dental                      veneers are recommended for teeth that are severely discolored                      or pitted. It even helps sometimes when there is too much                      space between teeth. The color of the veneer is adjusted to                      match your teeth and give you a wonderful smile.\nIf you have missing teeth cosmetic                      dentistry can help. Cosmetic dentists use dental implants                      or dental bridges in these cases. Dental implants are surgically                      screwed to the jaw. They are held in place by the implant                      screw that anchors the replacement tooth. Dental                      bridges are also false teeth. In this                      case they are held in place by surrounding teeth with a dental                      crown .\nCosmetic dentists also make                      Teeth that are chipped or crooked with tooth                      reshaping and contouring beautiful, this                      is done through Laser                      Dentistry . Even cracked or overlapping                      teeth are easily treated by them. Cosmetic dentists change                      the position of teeth by just a few millimeters to give a                      more beautiful smile. They can alter the shape and even the                      length of your tooth.\nOrthodontics is the area of dentistry dedicated to the diagnosis, prevention                      and treatment of alignment problems of the teeth and jaws.                      Orthodontic treatment involves the design and use of coorective                      appliances such as metal                      braces , ceramic                      braces , lingual                      braces , plates, headgears and functional                      appliances to bring the teeth and jaws into proper alignment.\nIn the past amalgam or metal were used in dental fillings. Nowadays cosmetic dentistry                      plays a role here as well. Metal                      fillings are effective but darken the                      tooth over time. Also they stand out too prominently. Composite                      resins or tooth                      coloured fillings are the newest offerings                      of cosmetic dentistry. They not only are strong but also can                      be matched to the color of your teeth. They are just another                      tool cosmetic dentistry uses to give you that beautiful natural                      smile.\nOur Emergency                      Dentist is available all Public Holidays including Christmas \u0026 Boxing Day, Our emergency dentist can take care of everything                      from a toothache, swollen face, broken tooth to having a tooth                      extracted.\nT EE TH                      IN AN HOUR - NobelGuide Teeth In An Hour is a new protocol that                      allows patients to leave the office with fixed teeth in less                      an one hour.\nThe                      Smiles Dr is an advanced centre for Modern Cosmetic Dentistry                      using high tech equipment and latest techniques for pain-free                      dental procedures to create beautiful                      smiles.

An investment strategy sets out the fund\u0027s investment objective and how that objective is to be achieved.\nInvestment decisions must be made in accordance with the investment strategy and superannuation laws.\nThe investment strategy should also be reviewed on an ongoing basis.\nThere is no prescribed format for the investment strategy, but it needs to reflect the purpose and circumstances of the fund. When preparing your investment strategy, you need to consider the following:\n(a) Risk and likely return from investments\nThe risk involved in making, holding and realising, and the likely return from, the fund\u0027s investments, having regard to its objectives and expected cash flow requirements.\n(b) Diversification\nThe composition of the entity\u0027s investments as a whole, including the extent to which they are diverse or involve exposure of the entity to risks from inadequate diversification.\n(c) Liquidity of fund\u0027s assets\nThe liquidity of the entity\u0027s investments, having regard to its expected cash flow requirements.\n(d) Discharging liabilities\nThe ability of the fund to discharge its existing and prospective liabilities. i.e. ability to pay costs the fund incurs and ability to pay benefits when members retire.\nYou should also consider the member\u0027s risk profile and needs, including age and time to retirement.\nGeneral advice warning\nComputer Super is a NON-ADVISORY service.

Cosmopolitan Living Qld has been trading successfully for many years in Qld and is a separately owned and operated business. The Qld operation is totally independent from the NSW operations.\nFor any Qld enquiries please phone 1800 997 887\nCompany Announcement 4/11/11\nAfter taking independent advice and considering all alternatives, it is with much regret that Perry Condoleon as (The Director) of the Company, has resolved to place Cosmopolitan Constructions into voluntary liquidation on the 4th of November 2011.\nIn the Financial Year 2010/2011 Cosmopolitan Constructions operated a profitable Contract Home Building division in NSW, however the company has recently incurred significant margin erosion in its Projects division. During these difficult times, The Director acknowledges and deeply regrets that this situation will cause financial hardship and inconvenience to our staff, retail customers, corporate developers, suppliers and tradespeople. For your information, affected parties please note the following\nAppointment of Joint Liquidators\nChristopher Darin and Nick Malanos from Worrells have been appointed as joint liquidators. Representatives from Worrells will be in contact with affected parties shortly. Otherwise,contact the above noted individuals on (02) 9249 1200 re further enquiries.\nStaff\nStaff have been terminated with all wages and superannuation entitlements due paid to date. The balance of staff entitlements will be paid in due course by the liquidator, based on funds held, receivables recovered or through the government scheme (GEERS). The Director takes this opportunity to thank all our loyal staff for their energy, commitment and efforts.\nSuppliers, Trades \u0026 Other Creditors\nThe Director is deeply regretful to all suppliers and tradespeople, who have been loyal, hard working and supportive of Cosmopolitan Constructions for many years. The Director will do his utmost to assist the Liquidator as requested to maximise payments to creditors.\nClients with Homes Under Construction / About to Commence with Home Warranty Insurance\nThe vast majority of clients with works in progress, and most with homes about to commence,should be covered by the home warranty insurance scheme. This is administered by S1CORP and should ensure the completion of your home or project. Notwithstanding, you are welcome to contact the liquidators for further information. Upon request, it is expected that the liquidators will be able to forward a file with all relevant client information within the fortnight.\nClients with Accepted Tenders or Signed Contracts\nWhere construction has not commenced and no home warranty insurance exists,to the extent that the intellectual property is Cosmopolitan Constructions, it will be assigned to clients to allow them to proceed with a builder of their choice. Once again, it is expected an information pack with relevant client information will\n",

The following is a quick guide that can help you make the right decisions.\nUse a current prescription\nPrescriptions do not always remain the same. Over time, your optometrist may alter your prescription based his updated evaluation of your eyes. Prescriptions are constantly changed to address any new problems or compliment any progress.\nDo not place an order with a dated prescription.  Use your most recent prescription when ordering online. If you have misplaced this, consider approaching your optometrist for a replacement. Check the date of your prescription. If it\u0027s older than 12 months, you may want to consider getting any new one.\nYour prescription will include your\nName\nPrescription expiration date\nName and contact details of the prescriber\nPower for the lens\nBase curve\nMaterial\nExamination date\nDiameter\nThe name of the brand/manufacturer.\nCheck your Order Twice before submitting it\nTake your time before making your order. Don\u0027t be quick to make a decision. Before you click the submit button, ensure that the contact lens that you are buying fits with your prescription. Pay attention to the lettering. It is important that you choose the right fit for your eyes or this may lead to long term complications. Correcting your order may also extend the processing period which will delay your delivery.\nDiscuss with your Optometrist about Substitute lens\nContact lenses Online is stocked with dozens of different brands (International and Australian). On rare instances, we may not have the particular brand that you are searching for in stock. But you are likely to find an equally suitable alternative. If you are unsure about the proffered substitute, consult with your optometrist. Your doctor will be able to suggest alternative brands that will still fit with your prescription.\nCheck the expiration date on the package.\nAll our contact lenses are sold within their outlined lifetime. Using dated lenses may damage your eye. Check your package when it is delivered. If you should receive a delivery with an expired date, return it immediately and we will immediately send a replacement.\nCheck the Product\nBefore you unpack the contact lens and put it on, check to make sure that your order is the right one and fits with your need. Your package should be the brand you ordered with the exact name and sphere. Other details include the base curve, diameter and cylinder. If your package is the wrong one, please return it immediately for a replacement. It is risky to use contact lenses that do not match your prescription.\nDon\u0027t skip your regular eye examination\nContact lenses online offers high quality vision correction solutions. But that doesn\u0027t mean that you no longer need an eye examination. Do not skip your annual or bi-annual eye examination. This will ensure that you are always using the best possible setting for your needs. As your eyesight improves, your doctor may alter your prescription to enhance the corrective factor. Regular visits will also ensure that your eyes aren\u0027t being overly strained with regular use or infected.\nContact Lenses Online: Beyond Your Order\nContact Lenses can be used to safely correct vision. But only if they are used the right way. Make sure that you buy contact lenses for the right reasons. It is the only way of guaranteeing that your eyes remain healthy.\nBefore buying your contact lens, it is advised that you go for an eye examination. The results of the eye exam can be used to determine if you are a right candidate for contact lenses and which lens is the right fit for your needs. Your optometrist will provide you with the right measurements for your contact lens and will also offer assistance and advice on how you can take proper care of them.\nContact Lenses: Things you should know\nWhy do you need a Prescription? Contact lenses are not toys. Wearing contact lenses without a proper prescription fitted by your optometrist can be harmful to your eyes.   Poorly fitted lens or contact lenses made from the wrong kind of material can very easily damage your eyes. It increases your risk of infection and could lead to permanent tissue damage.\nDiscussing with an optometrist will also make it easier choosing the right contact lens. Contact Lenses online is home to a vast selection of lenses. Making the right decision can be overwhelming if you aren\u0027t already familiar with the different options.

Now what? The following will help you get the best out of your new purchase.\nAlways follow the product instructions or those of your optometrist when cleaning your contact lens.

SF conventions routinely have programming on fantasy topics, and fantasy authors such as J. K. Rowling have won the highest honor within the science fiction field, the Hugo Award. Some works show how difficult it is to draw clear boundaries between subgenres; however authors and readers often make a distinction between fantasy and SF.In general, science fiction is the literature of things that might someday be possible, and fantasy is the literature of things that are inherently impossible.Magic and mythology are popular themes in fantasy. Some narratives are described as being essentially science fiction but \"with fantasy elements.\" The term \"science fantasy\" is sometimes used to describe such material.\nÂ \nright-menu\nHannah Montana Books\nCookbooks from Celebrity Chefs and Favourite Cooks\nDoreen Virtue AudioBooks\nScience Fiction Books\nCaroline Myss Audio CDs\nEckhart Tolle AudioBook CDs\nAnthony Robbins Audio Book CDs\nDr Wayne Dyer Audio Book CDs\nLouise Hay Audio CDs\nGough Whitlam Books for Christmas\nHousemeeting by Lano and Woodley\nLittle Golden Books\nObernewtyn Chronicles Books\nWheel of Time Books\nLearn Greek Language\nLearn the French Language\nChristopher Paolini Books\nArtemis Fowl Series\nClassic fiction on AudioBook\nMindfulness - Jon Kabat-Zinn Audio\nShakespeare Plays on Audio CD\nEmily Rodda Childrens Books\nSales and Selling Audio CD\nDeepak Chopra Audio CD\nPamela Lofts Books\nWealth Money Audio\nAustralian Politics Books\nNLP Neuro Linguistic Programing\nChristmas books\nJeannette Rowe childrens books\nSelf-Sufficiency books\nWeight Loss Audio\nMindfulness - Jon Kabat-Zinn Audio\nWhispers Relaxation CDs\nToyota Manuals\nYoga Fitness\nQuit Smoking\nLearn Arabic\nAudio Italian\nVampire Fiction\nBob Hawke Books\nLearn Japanese\nAudioBooks\nAudioBooks Biography\nSimonette Vaja\nMercesdes Benz repair\nParenting\nHyundai repair\nBox Set Kids Books\nExtra Info\nChristmas Bookshop has some great christmas present ideas.

The person nominated must be a person who is permitted to receive the death benefits under superannuation laws, otherwise the nomination is invalid.\nGenerally, people that can be nominated are either:\nthe member\u0027s legal personal representative\none or more of the member\u0027s dependants.\nLegal personal representative is defined as \u0027the executor of the will or administrator of the estate of a deceased person, the trustee of the estate of a person under a legal disability or a person who holds an enduring power of attorney granted by a person\u0027\nA dependant includes the spouse of the person, any child of the person and any person with whom the person has an interdependency relationship.\nBinding or non-binding\nThe superannuation laws also allow a member to set whether their Death Benefit Nomination is to bind the other trustees (or the other directors) of the SMSF or merely to guide them.\nBinding Death Benefit Nomination requires the trustees (or the other directors) of the SMSF to arrange for the relevant death benefits to be paid in accordance with the member direction. It is important to note that a binding Death Benefit Nomination lasts for only 3 years â€“ this means that nominations should be confirmed or make a new nomination at least every 3 years.\nNon-binding Death Benefit Nomination leaves the trustees (or the other directors) of the SMSF the discretion as to how the death benefits are to be paid. That is, they are not bound to follow the member\u0027s wishes.\nGeneral advice warning\nComputer Super is a NON-ADVISORY service. Computer Super does not provide personal financial advice.

The following is a quick guide that can help you make the right decisions.\nUse a current prescription\nPrescriptions do not always remain the same. Over time, your optometrist may alter your prescription based his updated evaluation of your eyes. Prescriptions are constantly changed to address any new problems or compliment any progress.\nDo not place an order with a dated prescription.  Use your most recent prescription when ordering online. If you have misplaced this, consider approaching your optometrist for a replacement. Check the date of your prescription. If it\u0027s older than 12 months, you may want to consider getting any new one.\nYour prescription will include your\nName\nPrescription expiration date\nName and contact details of the prescriber\nPower for the lens\nBase curve\nMaterial\nExamination date\nDiameter\nThe name of the brand/manufacturer.\nCheck your Order Twice before submitting it\nTake your time before making your order. Don\u0027t be quick to make a decision. Before you click the submit button, ensure that the contact lens that you are buying fits with your prescription. Pay attention to the lettering. It is important that you choose the right fit for your eyes or this may lead to long term complications. Correcting your order may also extend the processing period which will delay your delivery.\nDiscuss with your Optometrist about Substitute lens\nContact lenses Online is stocked with dozens of different brands (International and Australian). On rare instances, we may not have the particular brand that you are searching for in stock. But you are likely to find an equally suitable alternative. If you are unsure about the proffered substitute, consult with your optometrist. Your doctor will be able to suggest alternative brands that will still fit with your prescription.\nCheck the expiration date on the package.\nAll our contact lenses are sold within their outlined lifetime. Using dated lenses may damage your eye. Check your package when it is delivered. If you should receive a delivery with an expired date, return it immediately and we will immediately send a replacement.\nCheck the Product\nBefore you unpack the contact lens and put it on, check to make sure that your order is the right one and fits with your need. Your package should be the brand you ordered with the exact name and sphere. Other details include the base curve, diameter and cylinder. If your package is the wrong one, please return it immediately for a replacement. It is risky to use contact lenses that do not match your prescription.\nDon\u0027t skip your regular eye examination\nContact lenses online offers high quality vision correction solutions. But that doesn\u0027t mean that you no longer need an eye examination. Do not skip your annual or bi-annual eye examination. This will ensure that you are always using the best possible setting for your needs. As your eyesight improves, your doctor may alter your prescription to enhance the corrective factor. Regular visits will also ensure that your eyes aren\u0027t being overly strained with regular use or infected.\nContact Lenses Online: Beyond Your Order\nContact Lenses can be used to safely correct vision. But only if they are used the right way. Make sure that you buy contact lenses for the right reasons. It is the only way of guaranteeing that your eyes remain healthy.\nBefore buying your contact lens, it is advised that you go for an eye examination. The results of the eye exam can be used to determine if you are a right candidate for contact lenses and which lens is the right fit for your needs. Your optometrist will provide you with the right measurements for your contact lens and will also offer assistance and advice on how you can take proper care of them.\nContact Lenses: Things you should know\nWhy do you need a Prescription? Contact lenses are not toys. Wearing contact lenses without a proper prescription fitted by your optometrist can be harmful to your eyes.   Poorly fitted lens or contact lenses made from the wrong kind of material can very easily damage your eyes. It increases your risk of infection and could lead to permanent tissue damage.\nDiscussing with an optometrist will also make it easier choosing the right contact lens. Contact Lenses online is home to a vast selection of lenses. Making the right decision can be overwhelming if you aren\u0027t already familiar with the different options. Learning more about contact lenses and the different materials that they are made from can help you make the right decision. For instance, some contact lenses are designed to be replaced while others can be worn for extended periods. You\u0027ll also find decorative contact lenses and silicone hydrogel lenses among other options.\nHow to Care for your Contact Lens: Quick Tips\nYour package has arrived and you\u0027re the proud new owner of a new set of contact lenses. Now what? The following will help you get the best out of your new purchase.\nAlways follow the product instructions or those of your optometrist when cleaning your contact lens. Rinse your contact lens carefully before soaking it in cleaning solution. Ensure that the lens is completely covered.\nDo not swim or enter a hot tub while wearing your contact lenses. Follow the use and replacement guidelines recommended by your physician.\nNever attempt to clean your lens by putting it in your mouth. Saliva is not an acceptable cleaning solution. Doing this will only expose you to a possible infection.\nDo not use product that have not been recommended by your optometrist to disinfect and clean your contact lenses. Always clean your contact lenses with fresh solution. Do not re-use old solution as this will increase you risk of catching an infection.\nKeep your hands clean and dry before handling your contact lens. Change your contact lens solution everyday even if you only use your contact lenses periodically.\nAbove all, it is important to remember that your contact lenses are medical tools and need to be treated with the right amount of care. Use your contact lenses carefully. Wearing your contact lens for extended lengths may lead to redness, sore eyes or blurry vision.\nDo not share your contact lens with other people. This includes prescribed contact lenses and colored lenses used for cosmetic ends.\nMore contact lens care tips can be found here and here .\nNo two people have the same eyes and so the contact lenses which is best for someone else may not be the best for you.

Whether it is finding a new job, a place to live, packing or making new friends a total upheaval is not always the most pleasant experience. It can be less stressful by looking into Sydney removalists. Movers make changing homes a great experience. Using removalists means a lot of the work that normally goes into moving does not have to be done.\nRemovalists will come to your home pack and move your belongings to their new home. Most companies will let you choose just how involved in the moving process the movers are. If you want to pack your delicates, it will not be a problem. They can pack everything for you or just move the boxes that you have packed. A list is kept of all the large furnishings and boxes which makes it easier to ensure that all of your possessions made it to your new home.\nRemovalists Sydney also keeps the heavy lifting to a minimum. There is no need to strain your back or wear yourself to a frazzle when moving. Let a mover take care of the big furniture and boxes of heavy books. The company should mark each box so that the boxes will be staged in the appropriate room. Unpacking does not get any easier.\nThe removalists will take your belongings from your old home to the new one. Instead of moving, you can get straight into unpacking and decorating. You can put that extra energy that you conserved to use by finding that great new job or meeting all of your new neighbors.\nRead the rest of this entry\nComments Off\nFiled under: Moving\nAbout this blog\nFind out more about people, traditions, lifestyle and habits.\nRecent Posts\nLuxury Meets Affordability with Value Point Distribution\nWhat makes a good tyre\nCulture Of Poland\nPolish Australian\nSt. Adalbert â€“ Poland\nMust read\nWhy Poly Rain Water Tanks are Better than Other Water Tanks\nCategories\nAustralia\nAutomotive\nFashion\nHome\nMoving\nPoland\nTags\nAustralia Australians Bison Grass Vodka Fashion good tyre hard water job material Moving New Town oven place to live Poland Possum Possum Removal repairs stove Sydney Tempe tyres vodka water water softener Water Tanks\n",

    "text": "Main Page\nAbout the Firm\nOur Objectives\nOur People\nAreas of Practice\nOur Clients\nPublications/Articles\nLinks\nContact Us\nAbout Us:\nOverview:\nBarry F. Cosier \u0026 Associates is a Solicitor Corporation committed to serving our clients \u0026 the surrounding community. We aim to provide personal and comprehensive legal services at a reasonable cost to our clients.             Our firm is committed to provide the best possible service with the assistance of our wonderful staff and experts. We employ local staff that have local knowledge and contacts that enable our clients to feel important and being properly managed to completion. Our clients do not see a different solicitor or representative each time they come to our office and are comforted by the fact that we are reliable and efficient.\nOur History:\nThe Lithgow Office was originally established in 1988, opposite Braceyâ€™s Store in Main Street, as a branch of Knox Cosier \u0026 Hogan. At that time, the main office was located in Rylstone and the principal partner was John Knox. Barry Cosier started out as an Article Clerk for John Knox and was admitted as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 7 May 1982. It was at this time that he went into partnership with John Knox, who subsequently retired from the practice in 1989.\nIn 1996, Barry Cosier decided to focus on the then Lithgow branch and commenced practicing as Barry F. Cosier \u0026 Associates. Soon it became apparent that the small office was grossly inadequate and the firm accepted an invitation from the Coal Miners Union and moved into the 1st floor of the â€œOld Pie Factoryâ€, as it was then known.\nSince then, the firm has grown significantly from the once, fledgling business employing 2 staff (including Barry), into a thriving practice employing over 13 staff. Predominantly catering to the Mine Workers in the area, the firm services the Prison Officers of the Lithgow Correctional Centre, Teachers Federation and other union and non-union clients. We have a significant Conveyancing practice and cater to other fields of general law.\nProfessional Associations:\nWe are a registered Member of the following professional bodies.\nThe Law Society of New South Wales\nAustralian Plaintiff Lawyers Association (APLA)\nCharter Legal Professionals (CLP)\nOur success in this regard is due to our commitment to:\nUsing plain English and making sure our advice is easily understood;\nMaking the clients feel welcome and not overwhelmed in seeking legal advice and assistance;\nHaving friendly and easily accessible professional and support staff;\nHaving the solicitor with conduct of the matter attending at conferences and appointments with               the client;\nAttending on clients outside the office due to remoteness, injury and disability, sickness and or infirmed.\nMaking sure telephone calls are answered and returned by the support staff and professional staff;\nBeing able to provide a full range of services to our clientâ€™s so that they are confident that all of their legal needs and\nÂ Â Â Â  requirements will be professionally and efficiently attended to.\nHaving strong commitment to and a real and genuine presence, cooperation and support in the local and surrounding\nÂ Â Â Â  communities including community based pro bono services;\nTo assist our staff and clients, we optimise the use of the latest technology to provide information and services such as;\nClient database and accounting system providing instant information in respect to our clientâ€™s matters\nEFTPOS facilities to assist in the payment of accounts\nInternet Banking access to provide clients with the ability to transfer funds electronically\nDial in access for our Solicitors providing them with access to information when they are off-site\nSafe Custody facilities\nEmail facilities for our clients who are unable to visit the office in person\nInternet access to legal databases and Court decisions and rulings\nHead Office:\n50 Main Street\nLithgow NSW 2790\nP: 02 6352 1599\nE: info@cosier.com.au\nÂ  Areas of Service:\nLithgow\nMudgee\nBathurst\nSydney\nWollongong\ndetails Â \nHome Â  |Â  Disclaimer Â  |Â  Contact\nWebsite Â© 2010  Barry F.

Small incisions are made in the skin and a tube-like instrument called a Cannula is inserted to remove the fat.\nWhy do I need liposuction?\nIf you are frustrated by fatty bulges that you cannot shift no matter how well you eat and how much you exercise, liposuction can instantly and permanently remove the fat. You can look and feel great and feel highly motivated to keep up the good work and maintain your new shape.\nLiposuction is ideal for people who are already relatively happy with their size and weight, but just need some extra help to remove fat from specific troublesome areas. It is not a form of weight loss treatment and is not recommended for large volumes of fat removal.\nWhat is involved?\nLiposuction is performed under sedation or a light anaesthetic. The procedure takes between one and three hours depending on the amount of fat being removed. Incisions are made in the skin, and the fat is extracted using a cannula. You can go home the same day but may feel a little sore for a couple of days. Swelling and bruising can last for a few weeks, but most people are able to return to work within a week.\nIs there any down time? Is it painful?\nYou will need to wear supportive garments for a few weeks, which help the recovery process and to reduce swelling. You can expect to feel normal within a month and see the full results after about three months once everything is settled down.\nPrinciple Doctor:\nDr. Eddy Dona\nBella Vista\nCONTACT US\nAddress:\nLexington Dr,  Bella Vista NSW\nPhone:\n1300 373 662\nEmail:\ninfo@drdona.com.au\nWeb:\nwww.drdonaplasticsurgery.com.au\nTESTIMONIAL\nVery happy with professionalism and advice given throughout ...\nT.

Australian Plastic        Surgeons and hospital quality control methods are amongst some of the very best in the world. In contrast, in some countries overseas        you have absolutely no way of determining whether your surgeon\u0027s training, the hospital facilities, hygiene and infective control        methods are up to standard. Also, the implants used in cheaper surgery are typically of poor quality and would not be approved by        Australian standards. Finally, plastic surgery is not just about the operation - aftercare is vital and may not be possible with        overseas plastic surgery.\nWill a tummy tuck leave a big visible scar?\nNo. Every operation will leave some scarring. However, the role of a great Plastic Surgeon is to ensure the scar is as fine as         possible, and in a position that is generally not visible. In a tummy tuck, the scar runs horizontally along your lower abdomen from        hip to hip, just above the pubic region, and is not visible when wearing a bikini.\nIs there is a lot of downtime after plastic surgery?\nNo. Downtime is dependent on the individual and the type and number of procedures undertaken. However, a skilled Plastic Surgeon        will employ a number of techniques for any given procedure to reduce your downtime to an absolute minimum.  A breast augmentation for        instance, will require one week off work if you work is relatively sedentary, for instance office work.\nMove\nClose\nQuestions and Answers for ------\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\n",

If you give out endorsements to everyone for all their skills simply to get back as many endorsements as possible in order to rank higher in searches, youâ€™ve made the endorsement of your skills and the skills of others pointless.Â  It makes your support of someone a throwaway commodity that anyone can have, provided they endorse you for something in return.Â  In the end, you may rank higher in searches for a particular skill, but are you really a master of that skill or have you simply endorsed enough people to get reciprocal endorsements back?\nBoth sides of the argument are valid and should be looked at for different purposes.Â  If your objective is to increase SEO, then this function will be of benefit to you.Â  If your objective in the market is to enhance your reputation from a quality or authenticity perspective, then youâ€™re better to endorse those who you believe are worthy of it and expect to be endorsed back for your strongest skills.Â Â  By looking at the skills that you are not endorsed for, you will also get a good indication of which skills you need to work on, or communicate more effectively in the market.\nSupporting Fitted for Work\nHelping women experiencing\ndisadvantage to find and keep work.\nCandidate Centre\nClick here to Login Â |Â  Register as a new candidate\nÂ© Copyright Carrera Partners 2013\n",

You can reasonably expect that sentiment has improved further through February and into March.\nWhen you drill down into the Investment Trends survey of 820 investors - taking note that this is a survey deliberately of investors rather than a broader \"consumer\" survey -what becomes clear is that while people are much more positive about the Australian sharemarket they are also strongly influenced by lower interest rates and the prospect they will go lower and as a result investor intentions are shifting away from bank term deposits towards shares.\nThere is seemingly a rational logic at work here - as yields on things like term deposits fall investors are forced to look elsewhere for comparable or higher returns.\nThe media can be an effective - if somewhat short-sighted - messenger at times like these. Headlines declaring that equities are now \"safe\" to buy back into certainly strikes an emotional chord but a rational investor would do well to question what it is that makes something \"safer\" just because its price has risen.\nThat should not be misconstrued as a commentary on whether Australian shares are under or overvalued at this point in time, rather it is a simple reminder that just because prices have been rising in recent times and confidence has been rebuilt in the sharemarket there are no guarantees of future returns.\nThe investors in the Investment Trends survey overwhelmingly think the broader Australian sharemarket will continue to go up in the short-term - 84 per cent expect shares to go up in the year ahead and that figures climbs to 92 per cent when people are asked whether shares will rise in the next five years.\nGiven the timeframes generally advised for sharemarket investments and the market\u0027s long-term growth figures perhaps that level of expectation for some level of growth is reasonable.\nBut if you go back to September 2011 the monthly survey results show us that the high level of expectations of positive returns has been amazingly constant hovering between 90 and 92 per cent.\nMore telling is that not only were those investors highly positive but they expected returns to range between 18 per cent and 24 per cent.\nNow if expectations could be translated into reality that would be a certain path to wealth creation but the gap between expectation and reality is often very wide - the ASX/S\u0026P300 index delivered a positive but modest 2.6 per cent return over the five years to the end of February.\nThe reality is no-one knows what will happen in the next five years. Perhaps we are due another strong sharemarket run, perhaps not.\nWe do know from behavioral finance studies that as human beings we have a tendency to use short-term historical numbers as \"anchors\" for future long-term predictions.\nWhen levels of confidence and certainty are rising by all means enjoy the positive atmosphere but remember some of the key lessons from the seminal investment book The Random Walk Down Wall Street by Dr Burton Malkiel.\nSimply put they are: do not try to time markets, build a diversified portfolio and rebalance it regularly.\nBy Robin Bowerman\nSmart Investing Principal \u0026 Head of Retail,\nVanguard Investments Australia\n15thÂ  March 2013\n15th-April-2013\nSite by PlannerWeb\nConsidines Financial Services Pty Ltd : 16-18 Croydon Road, VIC 3136 | ph: (03) 9725 3200\nCorporate Authorised Representative of Charter Financial Planning Limited ABN 35 002 976 294\nAustralian Financial Services Licensee  License number 234665\nPrinciple Address:  750 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria 3008\nCharter Financial Planning Limited is only responsible for advice provided by Considines Financial Sevices Pty Ltd under the terms of Authorisation (Authorised Representative) of the Licensee.\nÂ Â I have read \u0026 agree to the terms described above\n",

    "text": "CorrosionElectronics Pty Ltd\nÂ \nSite MenuÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \nÂ \nTransformer Rectifiers (TR)Â \nCorrosion Electronics offers a wide range of transformer rectifiersÂ Â to suit a variety ofÂ cathodic protection (CP)Â applications. Whether itsÂ battery powered or AC powered and operating at millamps or hundreds of amps, Corrosion Electronics can help you with your transformer rectifier design and provide you with a product suitably tailored to your needs.\nLets start with the cabinet ...\nTransformer rectifiers can come in a variety of different cabinet sizes, many of the TR\u0027s that we build are assembled into off-the-shelf type cabinets. Using these off-the-shelf type cabinets can have a dramatic impact on lowering the cost of building a transformer rectifier (designing customised cabinets can be time consuming and costly to manufacture by comparison).\nAll                       of our transformer rectifier cabinets                       used can either be wall mounted, mounted                       onto a plinth or even pole mounted if                       necessary.\nThe                       picture to the left is an example                       transformer rectifier built by Corrosion                       Electronics using an off-the-shelf 316                       stainless steel cabinet featuring an IP66                       rating, padlockable swing handle,                       rainhood and a custom made galvanised                       floor stand.\nAll                       cabinets are available in either                       powdercoated mild steel, powdercoated                       aluminium or 316 stainless steel. If you                       require your TR to be in a particular                       colour - it can also be                       arranged.\nCorrosion Electronics isÂ wellÂ accustomed to handling transformer rectifier designs that involve customised cabinets. Providing customised cabinetsÂ can become Â necessary when concerned with large scale TR designs or satisfying installation needs.\nChoosing a method of control ...\nTransformer rectifiers essentially convert incoming AC power into a DC output. This can be acheived using different means. Below you will find information on a few of the control methods that can be used in transformer rectifiers and how they can differ.\n1) Manual Control\nManual control is a very simple control method which primarily refers to the using of a variable autotransformer (variac) and/or a tapped transformer to produce a variable constant voltage DC supply on the output.\nThe                       controls for operating the transformer                       rectifier will typically consist of a                       single dial which can be turned clockwise                       or anticlockwise to increase or decrease                       the DC output.\nThe                       photo shown on the right is of a small 5A                       / 20V manually controlled TR manufactured                       for a cathodic protection                       system.\n(Note                       the dial as the only form of output adjustment)\nThe main       limitation with using this form of       controlÂ is that       the output is essentially only \"Constant Voltage\" which       can vary significantly depending on the output load. It       is not possible to provide constant current or constant       potential control.\nFor more information on manual control       - please click here .\n2) Phase Angle Control\nCorrosion       Electronics is able to offer Phase Angle Control in       almost every application apart from solar output       regulation.Â  This mode of control has proven to be a       very rugged and reliable means of producing a DC output       voltage.\nWhether your needing a single output       Transformer RectifierÂ or even a multiple output       Transformer Rectifier - Â Phase Angle Control can be       adapted to       suit.Â \nFEATURES:\nMilliamps to thousands of                   amps output current\nConstant Volts/Amps/Ref                   Potential\nRugged electronic control                   (High voltage rated                   devices)\nRelatively easy to protect                   from lightning transients\nSingle and 3 phase power                   input\nSoft start on power-up or                   after interruption\nOutput \"Power Good\"                   Indication\nOptional \"Interrupt Freeze\"                 to promote smooth transistion                 from\nOFF to ONÂ  - suits DCVG                 surveys on pieplines\nOptional                 remote control\nÂ \nThanks to the                       introduction of our DCR3P module,                       Corrosion Electronics is able to provide                       a TR that incorporates Phase Angle                       Control and a modular design                       approach.\nWith the DCR3P module,                       most of the DC rectifier components are                       mounted onto a metal chassis which is                       affixed to the rear panel of the TR. A                       ribbon cable connects the DCR3P module to                       the PC42 user control interface situated                       on the front panel of the                       TR.\nDCR3P                 Module mounted\non rear                 panel\nÂ \nFor more information on the DCR3P module and the PC42 interface please click here .\n3) Switched Mode Control (SMPS)\nSwitched mode power supplies are commonly used throughout the world today and offer distinct advantages over any other method of control.\nSome of these advantages are:\nHigh operating efficiency                   (\u003e80%)\nLow heat                   dissipation\nVery low AC ripple on the                   DC output\nThe high efficiency of SMPS controllers make them ideally suited to installations using battery power as an input.\nThe switched mode controllers currently offered by corrosion electronics are available in either a common positive or common negative configurations and can output anything up to 30V / 10A.\nFor more information on the switched mode control options that we offer - click here .\nÂ \nNeed a                 saltÂ Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \nÂ  meterÂ for yourÂ Â Â  swimming pool ?

They continued          operation until 1923 when the low price of copper saw the demise of both          the mines and the smelters.\nThe town\u0027s maritime          history dates back to the times of Matthew Flinders and his discovery          and mapping of Spencer Gulf. Shipping was also important for the export          of wheat from the Yorke Peninsula and \"grain races\" were quite          common in the 1930s when captains of the sailing ships would race to see          who could get home the quickest.\n",

Â \nÂ \nThe belowÂ attempts to break the process down;\nÂ \n1. Can you afford it\nThe first thing to do is to speak with a Financier Consultant about your potential budget and options. Your budget will depend on the lender\u0027s conditions and your ability to repay the loan - don\u0027t let repayments adversely affect your ability to pay bills or enjoy a normal life. Don\u0027t forget to factor in costs such as legal fees, stamp duty, insurance and loan application fees.\nÂ \n2. Research and ask Questions\nMake a short list of your preferred location, requirements and features of the property - Open for Inspection are a great place to start your search. If, after that you want to pursue a property further, you can organise to have a builder also look it over to make sure that structurally it\u0027s what you expect. Of course unless you know someone who\u0027ll do you a favour, you\u0027ll have to pay for their services.\nÂ \n3. Make an offer\nWhen you find a property that suits your requirements then you will Make an Offer to Purchase. Your Offer would have to be an amount the vendor would be happy to accept. So it\u0027s a good idea to be aware of the going rate for similar properties in the area. This you will gather from your research. Your Offer will comprise of a Offered amount, Conditions on your Offer, Deposit amount, potential Settlement date and details of who is making the Offer. There is no guarantee the vendor will accept your Offer, and unless they do the property will remain on the market.\nÂ \n4. Contract of\nSale\nIf your offer is accepted then you will be required to sign a Contract of Sale. The Contract outlines details of the property being sold as well as your offer. Once signed you have 2 days to cooling-off - allowing you to be happy with your decision. Then after those two days you have to pay a deposit on the Contract which is monies that go towards the end sale amount.\nÂ \n5. Settlement - Congratulations!\nOnce you have paid a deposit on the Contract of Sale will need to Appoint a Conveyancer to act on your behalf to settlement. Your Conveyancer will handle all the relevant paperwork in transferring the ownership of the property to you. Settlement day is when all transfers occur and you are handed the keys to your new home.\nÂ \nÂ \nGovernment funding is available to eligable First Home Buyers.

Whether you are a personal trainer desiring involvement in the strength and conditioning field, or a coach involved in a specific sport or variety of sports, this course will diversify and improve your training and conditioning skills. Memorization takes a step back to integration as you are challenged to apply scientific principles in a practical and methodological manner. This course is about teaching you to design advanced training programs for your athletes/clients. As a P-SCE you will learn how to: Â \nFormulate      and plan training to meet the natural adaptation continuum of the human      neuromuscular system.\nEffectively      plan in accordance with the competition schedule.\nTrain      the dominant abilities (i.e. maximum speed, power or muscular endurance)      required to achieve peak performance for each sport.\nManipulate      the training variables to create the specific physiological adaptation      needed for athletes to reach peak performance.\nPlan a specific plyometric      training program with varied exercises and intensity levels.\nPre requisites/ Recommendations (not compulsory)\nIt is recommended that you have an education in the health and fitness/strength and conditioning area and an affiliation with Fitness Australia, Reps, NSCA, ASCA, Tudor Bompa Institute etc.\nRequired   Texts:\nâ€˜Periodization   Training for Sports 2nd Editionâ€™ by Dr. Tudor Bompa.\n(This you   purchase separately as it is not included in the total course fee).\nRecommended   Texts:\nâ€˜Periodization:   Theory and Methodology of Trainingâ€™ by Dr. Tudor Bompa\nÂ \nTesting Information:\nTo successfully obtain the P-SCE certification, you must achieve 70% or more on all testing components. Estimated study/ research time with assessment/exam completion is 50 hours. The maximum time allowed to complete this course/exam is 6 months.

Applied muscle physiology â€“ Multiple Choice\n2. Variables of training â€“ True or False\n3. Theory knowledge â€“ Short answers\n4. Program design â€“ Short answers\n5. Annual plan design â€“ Periodization models\nYour total investment cost for the P-SCE certification course is $550 with the option of paying a deposit of $225 and the remaining at a later date before your certification is awarded.\nThis includes distance tutorial, exam marking, and the certificate signed by Dr Tudor Bompa, which you will receive upon successful completion of the exam/course and total payment.

Longer lengths are ok. Volume loss may exceed 3dB and frequency response may also be effected. 8 ohm Â½ length for 4 ohm\nAWG (American Wire Guage) Rule of thumb:\nWhen the diameter of a wire is doubled, the AWG will decrease by 6. (e.g. No. 2 AWG is about twice the diameter of No. 8 AWG.)\nWhen the cross-sectional area of a wire is doubled, the AWG will decrease by 3. (e.g. Two No. 14 AWG wires have about the same cross-sectional area as a single No. 11 AWG wire.)\nAdditionally, a decrease of ten gauge numbers, for example from No. 10 to 1/0, multiplies the area and weight by approximately 10 and reduces the resistance by approximately 10.

A couple of weeks ago I went out intending to do a long, slow distance run early in the morning (about 7am).

It is important for everyone, regardless of age. Incorporating regular strength training into your fitness program will increase your lean muscle mass, which in turn will allow your body to burn calories more efficiently which will result in a reduction of body fat.

What they are A side stitch is a sharp pain which usually occurs on the right side under the lower edge of the ribcage.

Rest days are when the real results of your hard work take place: muscles repair and strengthen and energy is replenished.Â A well designed program will include rest days and modified workouts/cross training, as well as changes in intensity, time [...]\nFiled under Comotion Fitness , exercise , heart rate , injury , medical condition , psychological , training , wellbeing Â· Tagged with exercise , injury , medical condition , personal training , recovery , training , wellbeing\nPost-exercise recovery\nPosted by Sandi on June 30, 2011 Â· Leave a Comment Â \nWhat happens during recovery Including recovery time in any exercise program is important because the body uses this time to adapt to the stress of exerciseâ€”repairing damaged muscle tissue and replenishing depleted energy stores. If the body is not allowed enough time to repair and replenish, muscle breakdown will continue and in extreme cases overtraining [...]\nFiled under Comotion Fitness , exercise , stretching Â· Tagged with exercise , injury , personal training , recovery , training\nIâ€™m already warm!\nPosted by Sandi on May 9, 2011 Â· Leave a Comment Â \nOne of my teenaged clients got a little exasperated with me one 30 degree day last summer because I said we had to warm up. She hates warming up. She rolled her eyes and said something like â€˜Iâ€™m warm alreadyâ€¦are you serious?â€™ So maybe I should explain exactly what â€˜warming upâ€™ is all about.

But if you change your mind about your purchase, you can return your contact lenses for a refund or exchange provided that the items are still in their original condition.\nGuide to Buying your Online Contact Lenses\nOnline transactions can be tricky, especially if you\u0027ve never gone through the motions before. The following is a quick guide that can help you make the right decisions.\nUse a current prescription\nPrescriptions do not always remain the same. Over time, your optometrist may alter your prescription based his updated evaluation of your eyes. Prescriptions are constantly changed to address any new problems or compliment any progress.\nDo not place an order with a dated prescription.  Use your most recent prescription when ordering online. If you have misplaced this, consider approaching your optometrist for a replacement. Check the date of your prescription. If it\u0027s older than 12 months, you may want to consider getting any new one.\nYour prescription will include your\nName\nPrescription expiration date\nName and contact details of the prescriber\nPower for the lens\nBase curve\nMaterial\nExamination date\nDiameter\nThe name of the brand/manufacturer.\nCheck your Order Twice before submitting it\nTake your time before making your order. Don\u0027t be quick to make a decision. Before you click the submit button, ensure that the contact lens that you are buying fits with your prescription. Pay attention to the lettering. It is important that you choose the right fit for your eyes or this may lead to long term complications. Correcting your order may also extend the processing period which will delay your delivery.\nDiscuss with your Optometrist about Substitute lens\nContact lenses Online is stocked with dozens of different brands (International and Australian). On rare instances, we may not have the particular brand that you are searching for in stock. But you are likely to find an equally suitable alternative. If you are unsure about the proffered substitute, consult with your optometrist. Your doctor will be able to suggest alternative brands that will still fit with your prescription.\nCheck the expiration date on the package.\nAll our contact lenses are sold within their outlined lifetime. Using dated lenses may damage your eye. Check your package when it is delivered. If you should receive a delivery with an expired date, return it immediately and we will immediately send a replacement.\nCheck the Product\nBefore you unpack the contact lens and put it on, check to make sure that your order is the right one and fits with your need. Your package should be the brand you ordered with the exact name and sphere. Other details include the base curve, diameter and cylinder. If your package is the wrong one, please return it immediately for a replacement. It is risky to use contact lenses that do not match your prescription.\nDon\u0027t skip your regular eye examination\nContact lenses online offers high quality vision correction solutions. But that doesn\u0027t mean that you no longer need an eye examination. Do not skip your annual or bi-annual eye examination. This will ensure that you are always using the best possible setting for your needs. As your eyesight improves, your doctor may alter your prescription to enhance the corrective factor. Regular visits will also ensure that your eyes aren\u0027t being overly strained with regular use or infected.\nContact Lenses Online: Beyond Your Order\nContact Lenses can be used to safely correct vision. But only if they are used the right way. Make sure that you buy contact lenses for the right reasons. It is the only way of guaranteeing that your eyes remain healthy.\nBefore buying your contact lens, it is advised that you go for an eye examination. The results of the eye exam can be used to determine if you are a right candidate for contact lenses and which lens is the right fit for your needs. Your optometrist will provide you with the right measurements for your contact lens and will also offer assistance and advice on how you can take proper care of them.\nContact Lenses: Things you should know\nWhy do you need a Prescription? Contact lenses are not toys. Wearing contact lenses without a proper prescription fitted by your optometrist can be harmful to your eyes.   Poorly fitted lens or contact lenses made from the wrong kind of material can very easily damage your eyes. It increases your risk of infection and could lead to permanent tissue damage.\nDiscussing with an optometrist will also make it easier choosing the right contact lens. Contact Lenses online is home to a vast selection of lenses. Making the right decision can be overwhelming if you aren\u0027t already familiar with the different options. Learning more about contact lenses and the different materials that they are made from can help you make the right decision. For instance, some contact lenses are designed to be replaced while others can be worn for extended periods. You\u0027ll also find decorative contact lenses and silicone hydrogel lenses among other options.\nHow to Care for your Contact Lens: Quick Tips\nYour package has arrived and you\u0027re the proud new owner of a new set of contact lenses. Now what? The following will help you get the best out of your new purchase.\nAlways follow the product instructions or those of your optometrist when cleaning your contact lens. Rinse your contact lens carefully before soaking it in cleaning solution. Ensure that the lens is completely covered.\nDo not swim or enter a hot tub while wearing your contact lenses. Follow the use and replacement guidelines recommended by your physician.\nNever attempt to clean your lens by putting it in your mouth. Saliva is not an acceptable cleaning solution. Doing this will only expose you to a possible infection.\nDo not use product that have not been recommended by your optometrist to disinfect and clean your contact lenses. Always clean your contact lenses with fresh solution. Do not re-use old solution as this will increase you risk of catching an infection.\nKeep your hands clean and dry before handling your contact lens. Change your contact lens solution everyday even if you only use your contact lenses periodically.\nAbove all, it is important to remember that your contact lenses are medical tools and need to be treated with the right amount of care. Use your contact lenses carefully. Wearing your contact lens for extended lengths may lead to redness, sore eyes or blurry vision.\nDo not share your contact lens with other people. This includes prescribed contact lenses and colored lenses used for cosmetic ends.\nMore contact lens care tips can be found here and here .\nNo two people have the same eyes and so the contact lenses which is best for someone else may not be the best for you. For the latest information regarding this you should visit your optometrist or eyecare professional.\nContact Lenses\nFaq\nTerms \u0026 Conditions\nHealth Funds\nPrivacy\nContact Us\nAbout Us\nArticles\nBlog\nLinks\nContact Lenses Online is to be used as a contact lens replacement service only.

    "text": "The Conscience Vote\nPolitics for the Human\nHome\nAbout\nÂ \nHonesty is its ownÂ punishment\nMarch 19, 2013\nThereâ€™s an old saying that goes something like this:\nHow do you know when a politician is lying? Their lips are moving.\nThis has never been more true in recent times. Lies about children being thrown overboard. About young single women trying to get pregnant so they can buy televisions with their baby bonus. About people who â€˜jump the queueâ€™ so they can laze around on welfare. About same-sex marriage threatening our Judeo-Christian way of life. About unions, who only exist to line their pockets. About those same unions not being responsible for sacking leader after leader. About third parties who hold themselves, self-righteously, above the trough.\nAnd it goes on. Lies, lies, lies. And the worst lies of all? The ones that we hear, day after day, when someone says that an issue is â€˜too important to politiciseâ€™ â€“ and then goes to to do exactly that.\nAbortion. The National Disability Insurance Scheme. Asylum Seekers. Newstart. Climate change. Bridges, trains, the NBN, the list goes on.\nAnd not one party is immune. Not Labor, with its ringing tones of condemnation. Not the Coalition, with its fake sorrow that the government â€˜just doesnâ€™t listenâ€™. Not the Greens, with their insistence that only they truly care, even as theyâ€™re busily politicising every issue that comes near them.\nAnd you know whatâ€™s really sad about all this? The few people in Parliament who arenâ€™t solely interested in scoring political points, or holding power for powerâ€™s sake, are either silenced or sidelined as nuts.\nLook at the ridicule heaped on Bob Katter. This is a man who stands up, time and again, and politically shoots himself in the foot for his beliefs. He champions his farmers, excoriates the duopoly of Coles and Woolworths, roundly criticises all and sundry for taking advantage of indigenous people. He gets very little air time, either in the Parliament or the media â€“ and when he does, what gets reported has nothing to do with what he says. Instead, thereâ€™s laughter if he canâ€™t get his question out in the allotted time, or applause if he does. There are barely concealed smirks around the chamber when he rises.\nHow about Tony Windsor, possibly the sole voice of sanity in the House of Representatives? He holds a huge amount of power â€“ his vote can make or break legislation, and he knows it. When he gets asked how heâ€™ll vote, he says heâ€™ll consider the matter very carefully, and refuses to be drawn. Thatâ€™s not good enough, apparently, and out come the accusations that heâ€™s a traitor, that he holds his seat under false pretenses, since what people â€˜reallyâ€™ wanted was for him to support the Coalition. Then thereâ€™s the uglier muttering, never quite said to his face, but implicit in so many comments from media outlets â€“ that heâ€™s power-mad, and just enjoys making the major parties wait upon him.\nThat same accusation gets flung at Rob Oakeshott, but it seems to be far more â€˜funâ€™ to make comments about his tendency to be long-winded in his speeches. Ever since his joint speech with Windsor announcing support for a Labor government back in 2010 â€“ in which his contribution lasted around 17 minutes â€“ people make a point of ridiculing him. Strangely, those same people donâ€™t stop to consider there may be a good reason for such comprehensive answers â€“ that perhaps Oakeshott may simply want to be clearly understood. Heaven forbid.\nAndrew Wilkie â€“ accused of everything from being a turncoat from the Liberal Party to something of a tinpot dictator destined to fall in some kind of 2013 election â€˜coupâ€™ â€“ exposed the hypocrisy of the entire minority government bargaining process, at least as far as the Coalition was concerned. For that he was viciously attacked, and the Coalition simply havenâ€™t let up. His concern for problem gambling made him the target of an amazing smear campaign, and when he was hung out to dry by the government, his justified anger received nothing but indifference.\nBob Katter, Rob Oakeshott, Andrew Wilkie and Tony Windsor\nThese are the MPs who hold the balance of power in the House. These four men have exercised their responsibilities wisely and well. They donâ€™t play the game. They donâ€™t lie to make themselves look better, or to score a point. They engage with their electorates and across social media personally. Take a look at their Twitter feeds and see how many threats they receive every day â€“ threats of personal harm, harm to their families, even death. The language is vicious, and frightening.\nOf course, theyâ€™re not the only ones to receive that kind of abuse. The Prime Minister and Opposition Leader are just as much victims as the Independents, and that is something we shouldnâ€™t forget â€“ or condone. It doesnâ€™t matter who the targets are â€“ thereâ€™s no excuse for threatening someoneâ€™s safety.\nBut this is about honesty. This is about not playing the game of politics with false pronouncements of truth and compassion. This is about what happens to those who do their jobs without always looking to the next poll, or the next election, but who actually want to get something done â€“ even at the expense of their own careers. Does anyone believe Wilkie, Oakeshott and Windsor are under any illusions that both major parties will go easy on them in the upcoming campaign? The Coalitionâ€™s already said it will throw everything itâ€™s got at them â€“ donâ€™t think the government will do any less, or the Greens in Tasmania.\nWe live in an era where lies are spoken with utter sincerity by those who are supposed to represent us, and go unchallenged by those who are supposed to investigate and interrogate on our behalf. We live in a country where those who buck this trend are attacked, abused, undermined and ridiculed.\nHonesty is its own punishment, I guess. And if that doesnâ€™t make you wake up and start doing something â€“ well, I guess nothing will. And youâ€™ll get the government you deserve, come September.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\nLeave a Comment Â» |\nPolitics | Tagged: Andrew Wilkie , Bob Katter , lies , media , Rob Oakeshott , Tony Windsor |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nKevin Rudd resigns as ForeignÂ Minister\nFebruary 22, 2012\nAfter a week of feverish speculation, triggered by a leaked video, Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd tonight resigned his post in a late-night media conference from Washington DC.\nHe didnâ€™t mince words, either. â€˜I cannot continue to serve as Foreign Minister if i do not have Prime Minister Gillardâ€™s full support,â€™ he said, adding that Gillard had refused to unequivocally support him against particularly vicious comments from Parliamentary colleagues, notably Regional Minister Simon Crean. By contrast, Rudd had indicated support â€“ though it was definitely lukewarm â€“ with his statements that there was no leadership challenge on, and re-affirming her position as Prime Minister. The current situation â€“ with MPs and advisors popping up at every possible opportunity was a â€˜distraction from the real services of governmentâ€™, and having a damaging effect on business. It was also, he said, taking the focus away from the current Queensland election campaign, and Premier Anna Bligh deserved better.\nHe had some harsh words for factional players within the Party, referring to his own sudden forced resignation from the top job as removal â€˜by stealthâ€™, and that it must never happen again. That was, he said, the reason heâ€™d made his resignation announcement now, and that he would make a further announcement on â€˜his futureâ€™ before Parliament sits again next week.\nMost damningly, he gave us this scathing opinion of the media frenzy thatâ€™s surrounded the question of the leadership, seemingly since the day after Gillard came to power:\nâ€˜The Australian people regard this affair as little better than a soap opera, and they are right; and under the current circumstances, I wonâ€™t be part of itâ€™.\nAnd it has been a soap opera. Sky News referred to the speculation as going on for â€˜weeks and weeks and weeksâ€™ â€“ as though it had nothing to do with that at all. Which is, of course, utter rubbish. The media are, perhaps, more responsible for creating the soap opera than any tensions between Rudd and Gillard. Itâ€™s undeniable that Rudd is still incredibly angry about the way he was removed â€“ but itâ€™s equally undeniable that the media have taken every opportunity to suggest an imminent leadership challenge. And not just for weeks, either.\nAfter all, a soap opera is nothing more than private drama without the cameras, the reviewers and the ratings people, is it?\nSo, of course, speculation is now rife as to Ruddâ€™s next move. The bulk of commentators are convinced he will spend the weekend making frantic phone calls and alliances, and challenge Gillard for the leadership on Monday. In this respect, he would be following the same plan he carried out when he deposed Kim Beazley in 2006 . Whatâ€™s more, the playbook throws his actions into sharp contrast with Gillardâ€™s. Rather than orchestrate an eleventh hour ultimatum delivered from a position of power, Rudd  publicly submitted his resignation and went to the back bench.\nThis time, though, commentators believe that Rudd doesnâ€™t have the numbers. If he fails, he goes to the back bench, and the pressure will be on him to resign from politics altogether â€“ or at least announce that he will not stand again for the seat of Griffith. The idea that he wouldnâ€™t, according to Skyâ€™s David Speers, is â€˜farcicalâ€™.\nThereâ€™s another possibility. Rudd may not challenge. He might go to the back bench now, and bide his time. His resignation, together with other issues on which Labor has lost traction (largely thanks to relentless campaigning from the Coalition), could be the final element that ensures Labor loses power at the next election. At that point he could easily convince the Party that Gillard was unfit to keep the leadership; that â€“ to quote him on Beazley in 2006 â€“ what is needed is â€˜a new style of leadershipâ€™, to save the country from the damage that might be done by a Coalition government.\nItâ€™s a strategy that worked well for former Prime Minister Paul Keating.\nOf course, this assumes that Rudd is willing to Labor be soundly defeated. Is he quite that Machiavellian? Sure enough of himself that the Australian people would forgive him such a cold-blooded strategy, and that Labor voters would be willing to vote for him after living under a Coalition government? The suddenness of todayâ€™s announcement, coming as it did in the middle of the night while Rudd was in the capital of our most powerful ally, can be read as Rudd deciding to blindside the Prime Minister just before the evening news, ensuring he would be the story for the weekend. Or, as Graham Richardson suggests, there are articles due to be released tomorrow that are potentially very damaging for Rudd.\nOr it could simply be that he snapped, unable to take any more pressure from both the party and the media. Which, given his temper, isnâ€™t that unlikely.\nThereâ€™s no doubt this is a gift to the Coalition â€“ and an earthquake for Labor. Itâ€™s the Independents whoâ€™ll come in for close scrutiny this weekend, however.\nAndrew Wilkie has already withdrawn his support from Gillard, and, as usual, is playing his cards close to his chest. His hatred for the Coalition is well-known, though thatâ€™s no guarantee. Since earlier this week, when he was briefly embroiled in the soap opera by way of a misreported conversation with Rudd, heâ€™s been quiet.\nTony Windsor, speaking to media tonight, suggests an election might be necessary, but a change of leadership now was very risky. Judging by his performance in Parliament to date, whatever decision he makes now will be exceedingly well-considered.\nRob Oakeshott is nowhere to be seen.\nInterestingly, Bob Katter may be the wild card. His refusal to support Gillard as PM was based, in large part, by his distaste for the tactics used to remove Rudd. Should Rudd challenge and win, he may change allegiances â€“ or at least be more inclined to listen to Federal Labor. We still havenâ€™t heard from him, either.\nThe question for Labor, then, becomes whether its members can set aside personal animosity and vote for the person they feel has the best chance of beating Abbott at the next election. Although thereâ€™s no specific current polling, Laborâ€™s miserable figures on both Two Party Preferred and Preferred Prime Minister questions suggest that Gillard canâ€™t do it. Her own unpopularity with the public compared to Rudd only reinforces that. (And interestingly, take a look at the informal poll in the link above from The Age.)\nBut itâ€™s the caucus whoâ€™ll decide the leadership, in the end. Theyâ€™ll have to weigh up whether they want to preserve the kind of factionalism that ousted Rudd in the first place â€“ or take their chances with someone they treated appallingly for the sake of retaining government, and hope his words of needed party reform are just that â€“ words.\nThe Prime Minister will be releasing her statement later tonight, but wonâ€™t front the media until tomorrow.\nStay tuned.\nThe contenders - Prime Minister Julia Gillard and the man she forced out, ex-Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\n4 Comments |\nMedia , Politics | Tagged: Andrew Wilkie , Anna Bligh , Bob Katter , foreign affairs , Julia Gillard , Kevin Rudd , leadership , Rob Oakeshott , Tony Abbott , Tony Windsor |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nTony Abbott, the boy who criedÂ â€˜Censure!â€™\nJune 16, 2011\nFew would argue that under the current government, Question Time in the House of Representatives has become little more than a farce. Questions from the Opposition tend to be variations on the themes of â€˜When will the government abandon its toxic carbon taxâ€™ or â€˜When will the government pick up the phone to the President of Nauruâ€™. Add a liberal sprinkling of revisionist history on Building the Education Revolution, a soupcon of â€˜you knifed Kevin Ruddâ€™ and garnish liberally with transparent Dorothy Dixers designed to allow the government to verbally bash the Opposition â€“ and you can just about write the script for each sitting day.\nThen thereâ€™s the censure motions. Out of 28 sessions of Question Time, the Opposition has attempted to suspend standing orders preparatory to censuring the Prime Minister or the Treasurer no less than twelve times. Itâ€™s become so common that those who tune in each day to join the Twitter #qt conversation run a mock sweep on what time it will be before Opposition Leader Tony Abbott stands up to utter the familiar lines, â€˜I move that so much of standing orders be suspendedâ€™. That group includes many members of the media who are physically present in the Canberra press gallery as well as independent journalists, teachers, lawyers, full-time parents, students and a host of others. Itâ€™s quite a remarkable cross-section.\nThereâ€™s no doubt that these constant censure motions are a source of both hilarity and frustration for those watching. On the one hand, the predictable nature of it all is utterly absurd. On the other, however, it disrupts proceedings and wastes the Parliamentâ€™s time.\nThe motions to suspend are always defeated. Really, it comes across as an exercise in futility.\nSo why do they do it? Is it such a matter of deeply-held principle for the Opposition? Or is it â€“ as many suspect â€“ an opportunity for the Coalition to make long speeches accusing the government of everything from forgetfulness to incompetence to criminal behaviour â€“ all protected by Parliamentary privilege. Factor in the daily Matters of Public Importance â€“ where various Opposition speakers deliver long diatribes to a largely empty House â€“ and it starts to look more and more as though the Coalition are just going with the theory that something repeated often enough eventually enters the public consciousness as truth.\nItâ€™s a clumsy ploy, to say the least. And it carries the very real risk that people will not believe, but rather â€˜switch offâ€™ as soon as they realise itâ€™s being tried once again.\nTodayâ€™s Question Time was a case in point.\nAt 2.25 pm, Abbott moved to suspend standing orders in order to censure the Prime Minister. The immediate reaction from those watching was confusion that heâ€™d chosen to do it so early â€“ usually, the motion happens just before 3 pm. That quickly gave way to the usual dissatisfaction and mockery from the Twitter gallery as the government benches emptied. The consensus could well be summed up as, â€˜Meh, weâ€™ve seen it all beforeâ€™. We had indeed â€“ out of three sessions this week, this was the second time Abbott employed this tactic.\nThere was one significant difference this time, though. Abbott was acting on a motion brought by Greens MP Adam Bandt earlier today:\nThat this House:\n(1)    condemns the Gillard Governmentâ€™s deal with Malaysia that would see 800 asylum seekers intercepted in Australian waters and sent to Malaysia; and\n(2)    calls on the Government to immediately abandon this proposal.\nThat motion passed 70-68, with the support of Independent MP Andrew Wilkie and KAP MP Bob Katter. A similar motion was passed by the Senate in May, making this the first time on Parliamentary record that both Houses had directly condemned the government. It wasnâ€™t quite open revolt â€“ such motions are not binding, but it was a very clear signal to the Prime Minister that she did not have the support of the Parliament on her Malaysia policy.\nHer refusal to accede to the motion set up the conditions for a censure, and rightly so. Finally, Abbott had firm grounds. It was an opportunity not to be wasted â€“ but waste it he did.\nUnable to confine his argument to condemnation of the Malaysia plan, Abbott couldnâ€™t resist extolling the virtues of Nauru. â€˜There is a better way â€¦ Nauru is a humane solution! Itâ€™s cost-effective! There are no whipping posts in Nauru.â€™ It was the same argument the Coalition pushed all this week.\nJulie Bishop, seconding the motion, was similarly unable to keep to the issue. She covered a wide range of subjects in accusatory tones: â€˜Sheâ€™s betrayed her leader â€¦ this arrogant Prime Minister looked down the barrel of a camera and said â€œThere will be no carbon tax under a govt I leadâ€.â€™\nThe vote eventually saw the motion to suspend standing orders defeated â€“ and the effective end of Question Time with less than half of its alloted 90 minutes/20 questions expired. All in all, it accomplished precisely nothing.\nAbbott had strong grounds for a censure. He could have built an effective argument based on the Bandt motion alone, stressing the Parliamentâ€™s lack of support for a policy widely condemned as futile at best, inhumane at worst. He could have pointed out that a leader prepared to ignore the Parliamentâ€™s expressed will set a dangerous precedent. He could have appealed to everything from peopleâ€™s sense of humanity to the need for democracy to be consultative.\nHe might have started that way â€“ but he fell back on the same old formula â€“ haul out every campaign slogan, every slur, every tired bit of rhetoric the Opposition has employed against this government. In so doing, he virtually assured it would fail â€“ and he lost the support of any who might otherwise have put aside party loyalties.\nPerhaps there was no chance that the censure could work. It would have taken the co-operation of all the Independents, Katter and Bandt to accomplish that. But the attempt was rightly made.\nWhen the vote was defeated, someone on the Opposition benches called out, â€˜A moral victory!â€™\nIt wasnâ€™t. It was a wasted opportunity to properly criticise the government. And it was a wasted opportunity to gather public support for an issue with potentially dreadful consequences.\nAbbottâ€™s cried â€˜Censure!â€™ so many times, and for such trivial reasons. People have come to expect that anything he says on the subject will be the same kind of noise, designed to do little more than get a few sound-bites into the evening news. Crudely put, it just looks like he wants the attention.\nNow, at a time when a censure was not only appropriate but almost necessary, no one can be bothered to listen.\nThe Coalition have already made comments pointing the finger at Bandt, who did not support them on the motion to suspend standing orders. The implication is clear: Bandt doesnâ€™t have the courage of his convictions when push comes to shove.\nBut really, Abbottâ€™s got no one to blame but himself here. Gillard is free to defy the Parliament â€“ because he couldnâ€™t stop himself from crying â€˜Wolf!â€™ once too often.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\nLeave a Comment Â» |\nPolitics | Tagged: Adam Bandt , Andrew Wilkie , asylum seekers , Australian Greens , Bob Katter , censure , Julia Gillard , Julie Bishop , minority government , Parliament , refugees , Tony Abbott |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nCrisis averted â€“ forÂ now\nJune 1, 2011\nQuestion Time in the House of Representatives yesterday was anything but business as usual. For a few minutes, we teetered on the brink of a Parliamentary crisis.\nIt started when the level of rowdiness and generally un-Parliamentary conduct finally proved too much for Speaker Harry Jenkins. He issued a general warning to every member. Now, as he often reminds the House, if the Speaker formally warns someone, itâ€™s the equivalent of telling them they have one strike left. Any further misbehaviour would see that member â€˜namedâ€™ â€“ and when that happens, the member can be suspended from the Parliament for 24 hours.\nIn a situation where one party has a clear majority, this is not such a dire prospect. When the numbers are as tight as they are in this Parliament, however, a 24 hour suspension might be the difference between winning and losing a vote. Every member knows this â€“ and usually the warning is sufficient to pull them into line. Yesterday, however, Bob Baldwin (Liberal member for Patterson) apparently chose to risk it, and for his pains was formally named.\nAnthony Albanese, Manager of Government Business, immediately moved that Baldwin be suspended. It should have been a pro forma vote; after all, the motion was merely designed to support the Speakerâ€™s decision.\nIt wasnâ€™t. The Opposition, effectively challenging the Speakerâ€™s authority, called for a division. In the resulting vote, Independent MPs Bob Katter and Tony Windsor were conspicuous by their absence. My feeling is that theyâ€™d decided to unofficially pair themselves, thus having no effect on the eventual outcome (since Katter has generally sided with the Opposition on most votes, and Windsor with the government). The Greensâ€™ Adam Bandt and Independent Andrew Wilkie voted with the government. The real surprise, though, was Independent Rob Oakeshott. His was the deciding vote â€“ and he voted against the Speaker.\nBy voting against him, the House had in essence declared that they had no confidence in him.\nAt that point, Jenkins announced that, following Question Time, he would â€˜consider his positionâ€™ â€“ in other words, that he might resign. You could see the shock on some membersâ€™ faces.\nIn doing so, he was following the example of Speaker Jim Cope, who resigned from the chair in 1975 after the government refused to support his decision to suspend Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs Clyde Cameron.\nThereâ€™s no rule that compels a Speaker to do this, although itâ€™s considered Parliamentary protocol. Jenkins could have simply continued with the business of the day. In declaring his intention to consider resigning, however, Jenkins was sending a message.\nThat message was clear; the current House consistently disrespects the Speaker. Anyone whoâ€™s listened to or watched Question Time will be familiar with Jenkinsâ€™ frequent cries of â€˜Order!â€™ and the extent to which those instructions are ignored. Members, particularly those on Opposition benches, argue with many of his decisions. At times, four or five Opposition MPs have risen, one after the other, to challenge a single ruling.\nIn itself, questioning a ruling is not objectionable; when the challenges are simply repetitions of the original objection, however, it ceases to be anything but bullying. When that bullying goes on day after day, itâ€™s scarcely a surprise to find that the Speaker might consider that the House has no confidence in him. And when his own ruling is overturned, that can only confirm such a suspicion.\nAlmost before Jenkins finished speaking, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott leaped to his feet and moved a motion of confidence. In speaking to that motion he was both eloquent and â€“ unexpectedly â€“ heartfelt. He didnâ€™t quite acknowledge the Coalitionâ€™s role in bringing about this crisis, but he admitted that the minority government situation was difficult for everyone to navigate. Nonetheless, he had complete confidence in the Speaker. â€˜Please, please, Mister Speaker, please do not take this as anything other than an example of the difficulties of this new paradigmâ€™. In fact, he said â€˜Pleaseâ€™ nearly half a dozen times, and each time it sounded genuine.\nGillard clearly had long to think about her answer, and didnâ€™t shy away from making a political point in her speech. The government had always supported the Speaker, she argued. It was the Coalition that had voted against the motion to suspend Bob Baldwin.\nFinally, Rob Oakeshott stood. He was unapologetic about his role in the vote, stressing that he would always consider the rights of a private member in such situations. In this he was at least consistent; he voted against a similar motion to suspend Christopher Pyne back on March 23rd). Nonetheless, he too supported the Speaker â€“ â€˜Donâ€™t go,â€™ he said. â€˜Donâ€™t go, Mister Speakerâ€™.\nJenkins finally called the vote, which passed unanimously without a division â€“ and business resumed. A potential crisis was averted yesterday â€“ but had the Speaker followed through and actually resigned, it could have been a very different story.\nRemember, Labor holds government by the slimmest of margins â€“ only two seats. One of those seats needed to be sacrificed to install Jenkins as Speaker, reducing their margin to 1, which is incredibly tenuous. Should the Independents decide to vote against the government, any given bill or motion can be defeated just as happened yesterday. If Jenkins stepped down, the government would return to its 2 vote margin â€“ but a new Speaker would need to be immediately elected.\nLogically, Deputy Speaker Peter Slipper would be next in line. He is a member of the Liberal Party, however â€“ and if elected, the Opposition would have only 73 seats, making it much harder to defeat any government bills or pass their own. Itâ€™s fair to say that Abbott would probably resist any move to reduce his bargaining power.\nWhen the Parliament was first formed, there was considerable speculation that Oakeshott would take the chair. If Jenkins stepped down, no doubt that speculation would resurface. His support for the government on crucial issues such as carbon pricing and the National Broadband Network is very solid â€“ the loss of his vote could jeopardise these two initiatives. The same would be true of any other Independent.\nItâ€™s likely, then, that the government would be forced to fall back on another of their MPs, returning us to the situation we have now. But thereâ€™s always the possibility that both parties would simply engage in a staring contest, and hope that the other blinked first. And if neither did â€¦ well, we could end up back at the polls. Given Abbott is positively champing at the bit to fight another election â€“ and you could be forgiven for thinking thatâ€™s what heâ€™s been doing ever since the last one â€“ Gillard would be crazy to let it go that far.\nSo for now, the crisis is over, and itâ€™s back to business as usual â€“ yelling across the chamber, trotting out the lies and distortions, and pushing talking points instead of answering question. The government avoids giving out any information, while the Opposition reverts to the same kind of rowdy, disrespectful behaviour that provoked the situation in the first place.\nIâ€™d like to think Abbottâ€™s speech to the confidence motion was an indication that he realises the tenuousness of the situation, and the extent to which his Opposition has contributed to nearly plunging the Parliament into a potentially disastrous situation. Iâ€™d like to think everyone took a step back and re-evaluated their behaviour, and decided to put the country ahead of the opinion polls.\nIâ€™m watching Question Time now, though â€“ and itâ€™s like yesterday never happened. Christopher Pyne has already received a warning.\nBut it did. And it should not be allowed to pass out of peopleâ€™s minds with the next dayâ€™s news cycle. Jenkins showed that he has a point beyond which he wonâ€™t be pushed. And perhaps next time, it wonâ€™t be resolved so quickly and easily.\nThe kind of spectacle that Question Time has become is neither desirable nor irreversible. Debate and challenge can be respectful and rational. It requires discipline, and a willingness to set aside opposition for oppositionâ€™s sake.\nOur Parliament has been given another chance. It should make the most of it.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\n2 Comments |\nPolitics | Tagged: Adam Bandt , Andrew Wilkie , Bob Katter , Christopher Pyne , Harry Jenkins , hung parliament , Julia Gillard , new paradigm , no confidence , Question Time , Rob Oakeshott , Speaker , Tony Abbott , Tony Windsor |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nAbbott the wrecker â€“ straight from the horseâ€™sÂ mouth\nFebruary 7, 2011\nOpposition Leader Tony Abbott met with his Shadow Cabinet today. The topic was flood recovery, the aim to come up with an alternative plan to Laborâ€™s two-pronged approach of flood levy and spending cuts. Tipped off that Abbott was going to interrupt proceedings to make an announcement, the media â€“ mainstream, new and social â€“ pricked up its ears.\nSince the release of details of the flood levy, the Coalition have insisted that the entire amount for flood relief could be raised through spending cuts. To date, however, there have been no specifics. Apart from a re-hash of the â€˜NBN is badâ€™ message and a vague notion that â€“ because devastating floods have occurred â€“ we donâ€™t need a water buyback scheme, itâ€™s been all about the rhetoric. Thereâ€™s â€˜fat in the budgetâ€™. There are â€˜savings to be hadâ€™. Abbott is happy to sit down â€˜in a spirit of bipartisanshipâ€™ to show Labor exactly where those might be. The Coalition, it seems, are great believers in the idea that if you repeat something often enough, people will start to believe it.\nWhat we expected today, then, were a few details as to exactly where Abbott had found the â€˜fatâ€™.\nWhat we got was five minutes of railing against the government â€“ accompanied by Abbottâ€™s trademark â€˜Iâ€™m really savouring this momentâ€™ grin â€“ followed by a reassurance that people supported the Coalition, and that details would be forthcoming. Soon.\nShades of the Abbott-Hockey-Robb merry-go-round during the election campaign. Heavy on the sizzle, light â€“ or in this case, non-existent â€“ on the sausage.\nBut what we did get was the clearest possible indication of the Coalitionâ€™s goals in this Parliamentary session.\nâ€˜We will be doing everything we humanly can to get rid of a bad government,â€™ he said.\nâ€˜Every month that this government lasts is, in a sense, a worse month for our country than it should be â€¦ itâ€™s our job to bring about change for the better.â€™\nSo much for â€˜weâ€™re just trying to hold the government to accountâ€™. So much for â€˜we need to provide a credible alternative governmentâ€™.\nYou canâ€™t spin this. Itâ€™s a declaration; the Coalition are dedicating themselves to bringing down the Labour government, before July rolls around and the Greens take the balance of power in the Senate.\nListening to Abbott, you could be forgiven for thinking that the election campaign has already started. He accused the â€˜Rudd/Gillard governmentâ€™ (yes, heâ€™s still using that line) of being â€˜addicted to taxes, addicted to spending and â€¦ [having] no agenda for the country other than its own survivalâ€™. They â€˜canâ€™t be trusted with moneyâ€™, and they know it. (The mere fact that theyâ€™ve established an oversight authority to ensure that all flood recovery money is properly spent proves it, apparently.) The Coalition has a â€˜betterâ€™ plan, but we wonâ€™t find out about it in a hurry.\nSound familiar? Remind you of August last year? It should.\nIn the words of the immortal Yogi Berra, itâ€™s â€˜de ja vu all over againâ€™.\nThereâ€™s one crucial difference, though. Itâ€™s only been six months since the election.\nThat doesnâ€™t seem to matter to the Coalition, though. Their entire attitude since the Independents decided to support Labor has been that this is not a legitimate government, and that somehow the Liberal/National parties were cheated of their â€˜rightfulâ€™ place as leaders of the country. The â€˜we were robbedâ€™ rhetoric dropped off fairly quickly, but the sentiment remains. They protested that they werenâ€™t just out to â€˜wreckâ€™ everything the government tried to do, but their actions showed a consistent, almost mindless adherence to the principle of â€˜if Laborâ€™s for it then weâ€™re agin itâ€™.\nNow we have it confirmed straight from the horseâ€™s mouth. Abbott says itâ€™s the Coalitionâ€™s â€˜jobâ€™ to change the government. The only way to do that is to force an election, preferably before the dreaded â€˜Labor-Greens allianceâ€™ comes into full effect. And â€“ short of unforeseen circumstances necessitating a by-election â€“ that means blocking the government at every turn, until there is no alternative for Gillard but to declare the government unworkable and call a double dissolution.\nItâ€™s an incredibly risky proposition. To make it work, Abbott needs the three Independents on side. That means either wedging them against their own electoratesâ€™ best interests, or convincing them that the government simply canâ€™t deliver what it promised. Either will take a good deal of wrangling. Senator Barnaby Joyce in particular is vicious in his attacks on Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott, and even manages to incur the wrath of Bob Katter (arguably the most right-leaning of the three).\nEven if the Coalition canâ€™t convince the Independents, however, they can create a bottleneck. When nothing gets done, people get frustrated; and sometimes, the most appealing alternative is to simply wipe the slate clean and start again.\nWhether Abbott can manage to bring down the government is arguable. Whatâ€™s clear, though, is that he intends to try, and heâ€™s not even bothering to hide it anymore.\nYesterday on Insiders, the Opposition Leader twisted and turned over an incredibly insensitive email asking for donations for the Coalitionâ€™s campaign to stop the flood levy that was sent just as Cyclone Yasi bore down on far north Queensland. He refused to take any responsibility, or even apologise on behalf of his party. In an otherwise lightweight interview, he stammered and sweated and would only say that it wasnâ€™t his fault â€“ and in any case, he was just concerned for the well-being of all Australians.\nToday, with Deputy Leader Julie Bishop giggling at his side, he embraced the role of wrecker with a huge smile and undisguised relish. Gone was the serious man worried about small business and working families, the self-proclaimed protector of Australiaâ€™s standard of living. Instead we were treated to Abbott-as-headkicker, gleefully aggressive and seemingly interested in nothing more than the opportunity to usurp the throne.\nIt was all a little bit Richard the Third, really.\nSo the next time Tony Abbott or the Coalition stands up on television or at an event and says theyâ€™re just looking out for the ordinary Australian, remember his words today:\nâ€˜We will be doing everything we humanly can to get rid of a bad government.â€™\nThis isnâ€™t about us. This is about â€˜vaulting ambitionâ€™, that takes nothing into account but itself. And if we are thrown into turmoil by Opposition blockades, stalled programs and â€“ potentially â€“ another expensive election campaign and the chaos that would result from a Coalition government killing one initiative-in-progress after the other?\nThatâ€™s just a price weâ€™ll have to pay.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\n6 Comments |\nPolitics | Tagged: Bob Katter , budget , Coalition , election , flood levy , Independent , insiders , Julia Gillard , Julie Bishop , NBN , ozvote 10 , queensland floods , Rob Oakeshott , Tony Abbott , Tony Windsor |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nMythbusting\nSeptember 9, 2010\nAn old teacher once told me, â€˜Myths spread. After a while, people treat them as real facts. As time goes on, they become history.â€™\nIâ€™m not a fan of that idea. It might be fun to speculate about the possibility that there are alien spaceships held in a not-so-secret hangar in the middle of the Nevada desert, or that the Illuminati/New World Order/Elders of Zion control the world; but myths can also do damage if they go unchallenged.\nThis is especially true of political myths. Weapons of Mass Delusion, anyone?\nSo, with apologies to the Discovery Channel, Adam Savage, Jamie Hyneman and the rest of the crew, hereâ€™s a little mythbusting about the recent election and our new government.\nMyth No. 1: The Coalition won more seats at the election.\nThis is one of the arguments that the Coalition used â€“ and is still using â€“ to bolster its claims that it was the only legitimate choice for government. It won 73 seats, Labor only had 72. Unfortunately for them, itâ€™s based on some creative tallying.\nThe final shake-down of seats saw Labor and the Liberal/National/CLP/NLP Coalition tied at 72 seats each. To get the extra seat, the Coalition assumed from the start that Tony Crook, the Western Australian National, was part of their alliance. This simply isnâ€™t true.\nAlthough Crook eventually declared that he would support a Coalition bid for government, he made it clear that once government was formed, he would act as a cross-bencher. In other words, heâ€™s no different to Bandt, Wilkie, Windsor, Katter and Oakeshott. Each of them made a decision to support a particular party to form government â€“ which extends to promising to pass the Budget and not to pass â€˜frivolousâ€™ no-confidence motions.\nIf the Coalition is going to insist that Crook must be counted in their final tally, then so too must the other five MPs. That leaves us at Labor â€“ 76, Coalition â€“ 74. If it acknowledges that Crook is a cross-bencher, the tally is 72 all. Either way, claims of a â€˜right to form governmentâ€™ made on the basis of seats won fails to favour the Coalition.\nConclusion: BUSTED.\nMyth No. 2: The Coalition won more of the primary vote, so it effectively won the election.\nThe vagaries of Australiaâ€™s preferential voting system render this statement meaningless. We do not operate on a â€˜first-past-the-postâ€™ basis, as the UK does. Where there are multiple candidates, those with the lowest number of votes are eliminated, and their second preferences distributed among those remaining. And so on.\nThe primary vote is interesting, and statistically significant, but it doesnâ€™t determine who wins. In fact, Kim Beazleyâ€™s Labor won both the primary and two-party preferred votes in 1998, but lost the election because the Coalition won more seats. It happens. Itâ€™s a quirk of the system â€“ but thatâ€™s all.\nConclusion: BUSTED.\nMyth No. 3: The Independents made up their mind ages ago, but Gillard gave them extra time to grandstand and screw over the Coalition.\nThis accusation surfaced yesterday, and is based on the fact that Governor-General Quentin Bryce was in residence at Yarralumla on Tuesday. What was she waiting for? How did she know to be around? She must have been tipped off â€“ and the only way that could happen was if Gillard already knew sheâ€™d won.\nWhat can I say? This one belongs in the wingnut file along with â€˜we never landed on the Moonâ€™ and â€˜missiles hit the Twin Towersâ€™. If there was anyone in Australia who didnâ€™t know that Tuesday September 7 was Decision Day, they had to have been living under a rock. Oakeshott, Windsor and Katter had all said repeatedly that they would make the announcement. It would have been remarkable if the Governor-General hadnâ€™t been on stand-by.\nNo conspiracy required here â€“ just common sense.\nConclusion: BUSTED, MOCKED AND LAUGHED OUT OF THE BUILDING.\nMyth No. 4: Australia is now being run by a Labor-Greens â€˜rainbowâ€™ alliance and will  be the most Socialist government we have ever known.\nWhere to start with this one?\nWell, firstly, there is no â€˜allianceâ€™. The agreement between Labor and Adam Bandt â€“ which is freely available for anyone to read â€“ extends to Supply and no-confidence motions only. Labor gave certain undertakings in order to secure this agreement, primarily in the area of parliamentary reform. At no point did the two parties agree to a formal Coalition, such as that which exists between the Liberal and National parties.\nThe Greens are under no obligation to vote with the government â€“ and the government are under no obligation to support the Greens, should they put up bills that conflict with Laborâ€™s policy agenda.\nAs for the argument that this will be the most Left-leaning government in Australian history? I pause for howls of derisive laughter. Labor has been moving to the Right for decades. It may have done away with WorkChoices, but it hasnâ€™t done much else that could be considered even remotely â€˜Leftâ€™ â€“ it hasnâ€™t restored power to the unions, significantly expanded public health care, implemented protectionist agricultural policies or re-instituted free education. In fact, itâ€™s difficult to tell sometimes which is more Right-wing â€“ Labor or the Coalition.\nHaving the Greens in close proximity to the government might well prove to be beneficial for the country. If nothing else, they have the ability to mitigate some of the more damaging conservative trends in contemporary politics. â€˜Socialismâ€™, however, is the boogeyman word. It elicits a response from many Australians worthy of Pavlovâ€™s dogs. Rational thought ceases, and people salivate in fear at the thought that the â€˜Redsâ€™ are coming to take away our hard-earned middle-class prosperity. It doesnâ€™t matter that generally, those who rant most loudly against Socialism donâ€™t know what it is â€“ they just know itâ€™s â€˜badâ€™. To quote The Princess Bride: â€˜that word â€¦ I do not think it means what you think it meansâ€™.\nThose banging the drum would do well to read Glen Worthingtonâ€™s Research Note on Socialism . They might be surprised to learn just how much of Australian social policy has been shaped by Socialist ideas.\nConclusion: THOROUGHLY BUSTED.\nMyth No. 5: â€˜As sure as night follows dayâ€™, we will have a carbon tax from this new government.\nAbbott trotted this one out during the campaign â€“ sometimes several times a day. He seemed to think he was blowing the whistle on a secret conspiracy within the Labor Party and the Greens to dupe the Australian public into voting for them. Then, as soon as they were elected â€“ WHAM! Unexpected carbon tax! Bankruptcy for all! Weâ€™ll have to huddle together in our Snuggies because we wonâ€™t be able to afford to heat our homes anymore.\nHis strategists should probably have bothered to do their research. Neither party ever any attempt to hide proposals for a price on carbon â€“ whether an Emissions Trading Scheme or a carbon tax. One quick visit to their respective websites, or tuning in to a media conference, could have told them that. Sure, Gillard weaselled around with the â€˜citizensâ€™ assemblyâ€™ idea, but she never made any secret of the fact that Labor wanted a price on carbon.\nConclusion: TRUE, BUT WE KNEW THAT ANYWAY.\nSo there we are. That wasnâ€™t terribly painful, was it? Whatâ€™s worse, perhaps, is that it wasnâ€™t terribly hard to find the answers â€“ yet somehow, we hear those myths repeated every day. Weâ€™ve come to expect it from our politicians â€“ even in this â€˜kinder, gentler polityâ€™ that Abbott promised us â€“ but thereâ€™s no excuse for these myths to be mindless quoted in the media, and allowed to go unchallenged.\nIâ€™m hoping mythbusting wonâ€™t have to become a regular feature of The Conscience Vote; on the other hand, I think thereâ€™ll be quite a bit of mythmaking going on in the next few years.\nIf you notice a myth, or something you suspect is a myth, being repeated as fact â€“ challenge it. Do some research. Let me know, and Iâ€™ll publish it here.\nAbove all â€“ donâ€™t let an unquestioned myth become history.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\n12 Comments |\nMythbusting , Politics | Tagged: Adam Bandt , ALP , Andrew Wilkie , Bob Katter , carbon tax , Coalition , Greens , Julia Gillard , Labor , Liberal Party , media , National Party , Rob Oakeshott , Tony Abbott , Tony Crook , Tony Windsor |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nDonâ€™tÂ panic\nSeptember 6, 2010\nIn whatâ€™s looking a bit like a game of â€˜Hard to Getâ€™, the three country Independents are still not sure when they will make their decisions. Katter initially indicated that he would decide yesterday, but then made it known that it might not be until Tuesday. Windsor and Oakeshott agree on this, although Oakeshott even speculated that Wednesday wasnâ€™t out of the question. Today, theyâ€™re talking again with the leaders of the major parties.\nSurely theyâ€™ve made up their minds by now? What else can they possibly have to talk about?\nWell, we donâ€™t have any idea how theyâ€™re leaning, although that hasnâ€™t dampened the speculation â€“ and the condemnation. Hereâ€™s a sample â€“ see if you can pick the pundits from the punters.\nâ€˜Sadly, the independents have apparently been sucked into the Labor Party orbit, taking advice from partisans such as Bruce Hawker and GetUp.â€™\nâ€˜ â€¦the independents should not return this failed government.â€™\nâ€˜If there is a Liberal-National government formed, then that government will do its best to get those three out of office because they think that those seats belong to them.â€™\nâ€˜What a circus this is turning out to be. Windsor and Oakeshott are carrying on as if they have not made up their minds.â€™\nâ€˜Three formerly conservative Independent candidates, each humping baggage from their past affiliations get to choose the government. Three amigos? Three inflated egos more likely. If that is democracy, God help us.â€™\nâ€˜The longer this interregnum goes on, the more public sentiment skews towards another election.â€™\nThose are some of the nicer comments. A quick tour around media websites and Twitter shows just how strongly people are prepared to put their views, however â€“ lovely words like â€˜farce,â€™ â€˜power-madâ€™, â€˜incompetentâ€™, â€˜insignificantâ€™, â€˜jumped-upâ€™, and my personal favourite, â€˜holding the country to ransomâ€™.\nIt should be fairly clear by now that no one is going to hurry the Independents. That didnâ€™t stop Abbott publishing an open letter in the Sunday Telegraph that can best be described as three-parts â€˜the country is doomed if you back the Labor-Green allianceâ€™, two-parts â€˜the electorate has told you to back us, and besides, we like the bushâ€™ and one-part â€˜we love the bush so much that weâ€™ll make it our priority in governmentâ€™.\nIt was an extraordinarily clumsy move on Abbottâ€™s part. It smacked of desperation â€“ whether true or not, it gave the impression that Abbott was failing in his bid to form government. It also delivered a pretty hefty insult to the Independents. In going to the media to deliver his message, Abbott was turning up the pressure. Nothing in that letter needed to be taken to the public â€“ it was clearly a signal to the Liberal/National base to turn up the heat. Supporters responded enthusiastically, bombarding comment columns with advice for the Independents that ranges from heartfelt pleas to strident commands.\nLuckily, most of that appears to be water off a duckâ€™s back as far as Oakeshott, Windsor and Katter are concerned, although Katter seems to be increasingly irritated by the whole process. And who can blame him? Heâ€™s got people calling him every hour, stopping him on the street, even following him to lunch dates, all wanting to know if heâ€™s made up his mind yet.\nMaybe they truly havenâ€™t decided. Maybe theyâ€™re arguing details. Oakeshott hinted that there was a possibility one of them might need to consider changing his mind in order to vote as a bloc with the other two â€“ which might well signal a split in the ranks. Thereâ€™s no whiff of coercion, though â€“ they seem to be genuinely committed to figuring out the best possible solution. Consensus politics in action.\nThereâ€™s another factor here, though. Oakeshott drew up a list of parliamentary reforms, many of which parallel those requested by Adam Bandt and Andrew Wilkie â€“ an independent Speaker, for example. Labor signed on, which was hardly surprising, given that they have already committed to substantial reforms.  The Coalition has not yet done so â€“ in fact, is balking at some of the proposals .\nOakeshott wants both parties to sign on. Itâ€™s the clearest indication yet that the Independents are really committed to parliamentary reform â€“ they want a guarantee that no matter who gets to form government, the reforms will take place.\nGlenn Milne is reporting today that there are mumblings favouring Gillard , although he is careful to stress that there are no firm indicators. Meanwhile, Gillard has announced a media conference for 4.20pm today.\nWith only about 48 hours left in the decision-making process, perhaps the task now is to stop second-guessing and pressuring the Independents, and start thinking about how the business of government is going to function for the next three years.\nWhoever ends up in government is going to have to work closely with these Independents, and with Bandt and Wilkie. They wonâ€™t be able to rely on their numbers to push through legislation. Given the huge political divide between the major parties, and the flat refusal to even consider adopting each otherâ€™s policies, passing any new legislation is likely to rely on those five (possibly six, if Crook sticks to his avowed wish to be considered a cross-bencher) men.\nItâ€™s a matter for panic in some quarters. The fear-mongering ranges from speculation that the Independents might simply insist on lots of goodies for their own electorates, to assertions that they will cause irreparable economic damage with their narrow focus on the bush and their failure to understand â€˜big pictureâ€™ issues. Far better that we go back to the polls now. (Of course, this last sentiment conveniently ignores the very real possibility that we would simply end up in the same place six weeks from now.)\nA poll commissioned by a NSW lobby firm made the headlines today. Australians donâ€™t want a hung Parliament, they want another election! Weâ€™re â€˜fed upâ€™, apparently. Weâ€™re â€˜worriedâ€™. We â€˜think it would be betterâ€™ if one of the major parties had a clear win. After all, who knows what these Independents could do? Can we trust them? Are they up to the challenge? Itâ€™s all too frightening. Letâ€™s just pretend the election didnâ€™t happen, and do it all again.\nThe optimism of the first week after the election has transformed into scared nostalgia, if you accept that poll. Weâ€™ve had a glimpse of the future, it suggests, and â€“ to quote the movie Wayneâ€™s World â€“ â€˜we fear changeâ€™.\nWait. Stop. Breathe.\nLook at how these MPs have behaved so far. Every one of them has shown themselves to be principled, thoughtful, and concerned with the good of the country as a whole. Wilkie turned down $1 billion for his own electorate in order to secure an equitable arrangement for the nation. Bandtâ€™s concerns range far outside the â€˜traditionalâ€™ Greens focus on environmental issues. All five are absolutely committed to parliamentary reforms designed to redress imbalances in government and perhaps bring us back to a point where we are more concerned with getting things done than whether we can smear our opponents.\nHardly reason to panic, really.\nMinority governments can work. They already do work in Australia. And where they donâ€™t, itâ€™s likely to be the fault of a major party that sees itself as disenfranchised, rather than of those who hold the balance of power.\nSo how about this â€“ we all just unclench those white knuckles, take a deep breath and settle down.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\n2 Comments |\nPolitics | Tagged: Adam Bandt , ALP , Andrew Wilkie , Bob Katter , Coalition , Greens , hung parliament , Independents , Labor , Liberal Party , Rob Oakeshott , Tony Windsor |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nGreens back Labor forÂ government\nSeptember 1, 2010\nThe Greens have just announced that Adam Bandt will throw his support behind the Labor Party in its bid to form government.\nThis takes Laborâ€™s seat total to 73, although Senator Bob Brown was careful to point out that this is not a formal coalition arrangement. Bandt will support Labor in any no confidence motion, and not vote to block the Budget. If we count Crook as supporting the LNP Coalition (although this is by no means certain), the count is tied up â€“ again.\nIn order to get the Greensâ€™ support, Labor has signed off on a long list of undertakings.\nIn the area of parliamentary reform, there will be:\n* Restrictions on political donations, that would effectively undo the changes wrought by the Howard government.\n* Introduction of legislation to ensure truth in political advertising.\n* A leadersâ€™ debates commission, presumably to prevent the sort of nonsense that went on in this campaign. These debates may well include the leader of the â€˜third partyâ€™ â€“ as it stands, of course, this would be the Greens.\n* Two and a half hours for parliamentary debate on private membersâ€™ bills. This is a significant win; under the current system, the party Whips make all the decisions on how much time is allotted, including whether to allow debate at all. Obviously, then, any â€˜unpopularâ€™ bill can effectively be killed before it gets a decent hearing. We saw this happen to Senator Sarah Hanson-Young when she introduced a bill amending the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriage in February this year.\n* A â€˜moveâ€™ towards fixed three-year terms. From the language, itâ€™s clear that Labor has not agreed outright to support the idea, but at least it would be discussed.\n* Establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Committee, accessible by all federally elected members. This committee appears to be an expansion of the Charter of Budget Honesty, in that it would have the ability to provide information and costings on all proposed programs.\n* Treasury documents to be accessible to the Greens. This one is likely to cause alarm in some quarters.\nOther undertakings include:\n* A parliamentary debate on Australiaâ€™s role in the war in Afghanistan. Incumbent Defence Minister John Faulkner signalled his support for such a debate during the campaign, and it would become a reality under a new Labor government.\n* A referendum on Constitutional recognition of indigenous peoples as the first Australians. Both parties listed this in their election policy statements .\n* The formation of a climate change committee, made up of elected representatives and experts on climate change. Brown stressed that membership was dependent on a belief in the reality of climate change and a commitment to a carbon price. The committee would investigate options and present its deliberations and recommendations to Parliament. This effectively replaces key parts of both Labor and Greens policy, including the highly-criticised â€˜citizensâ€™ assemblyâ€™ proposed by Labor during the campaign.\nThe glaring absence here is any undertaking on same-sex marriage. Asked about that, Brown confirmed that the matter was raised, but that no agreement could be reached.\nBrown went on to say that, should the LNP Coalition form government, the Greens would not automatically take an obstructionist stance. He did state unequivocally, however, that his preference was for a Labor government, which he believed was more able to deliver both stable and effective good governance. He also absolutely ruled out any support for Temporary Protection Visas for asylum seekers â€“ a stance that puts a major hole in the Coalitionâ€™s asylum seeker policy.\nWith Bandt now declared for Labor, pressure now falls even more heavily on the four Independents and Tony Crook. Andrew Wilkie has already stated that he is prepared to consider supporting neither major party, if he considers them incapable of forming good government. He may find that he has sidelined himself, however â€“ if the three country Independents vote as a bloc, his support may well becoming meaningless.\nCrook is playing it close to the chest. All we have from him is a stated wish to be considered a cross-bencher, and complete rejection of a mining tax.\nAs for the country Independents? Part of Bob Katterâ€™s wish list appeared on the front page of the Townsville Bulletin . Heâ€™s asking for 10% of all mining royalties to be directed towards infrastructure in north Queensland, indigenous health funding, new dams and weirs for irrigation purposes, effective broadband for the bush, commitment to the CopperString power line project , and a ban on cheap imports of bananas.\nThe first deal has been struck, and now the horsetrading begins in earnest.\n* * * * *\nA postscript â€“ the Coalition are already taking to the media attacking the Bandt-Labor deal, exactly as Bob Brown predicted. Scott Morrison, their spokesperson on immigration, slammed the Greens for not making asylum seeker issues part of their arrangement with Labor. He also referred to the â€˜Labor-Greens Coalitionâ€™ several times, despite knowing full well that there is no formal coalition arrangement. This might be pure spin, a misguided attempt to panic the electorate and the Independents. The economy is in danger! The Greens want to destroy us all, and now Labor wants to help them!\nIt could also be an indicator. If the LNP Coalition really do see the Bandt-Labor deal as a formal alliance, perhaps thatâ€™s also how they view any pledged support to form government. In that case, Katter, Wilkie, Oakeshott, Windsor and Crook might well take that into consideration â€“ none of them want to enter into a binding coalition, but Abbottâ€™s government just might expect them to act as though they have.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\n1 Comment |\nPolitics | Tagged: Adam Bandt , ALP , Andrew Wilkie , asylum seekers , Bob Brown , Bob Katter , climate change , debate , Greens , hung parliament , indigenous affairs , Labor , Rob Oakeshott , same-sex marriage , Tony Crook , Tony Windsor |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nMandate, mandate, whoâ€™s got theÂ mandate?\nAugust 31, 2010\nMandate.\nItâ€™s an impressive word, isnâ€™t it? Positively drips with authority. Weâ€™ve heard it bandied about quite a bit in this election by the two major parties. Abbott â€˜has a mandateâ€™ because the Coalition has a larger slice of the primary vote. Gillard â€˜has a mandateâ€™ because Labor is winning the two-party preferred vote. The Coalition has the mandate because the people rejected the mining tax. Labor has the mandate because the people want better broadband.\nSo it goes. But what does that actually mean? What the heck is a mandate anyway?\nAt its most basic, a mandate can be defined as â€˜a command or authorization to act in a particular way on a public issue given by the electorate to its representativeâ€™. Seems clear enough. In this case, then, the â€˜public issueâ€™ is actually forming government. Also pretty straightforward â€“ so figuring out whoâ€™s got the mandate should be easy, right?\nNot if you read/listen to/watch the media. There are passionate arguments coming from both sides, and from all areas of the media. Most of these arguments sound rational â€“ or at least plausible, which doesnâ€™t help. Surely the party who got the most votes should govern? But wait â€“ we have a preferential voting system, not first-past-the-post, so should all preferences should be factored into the final decision? The commentary goes round and round and it just gets more confusing.\nThe Coalition are particularly strident in their claims of a mandate. The reasoning behind it seems to be that if they say it long enough and loud enough, people will eventually realise they are â€˜rightâ€™. Laborâ€™s not getting left behind on the mandate rhetoric, either. That nearly brought them undone last night, when the Australian Electoral Commission suddenly changed the way it calculated the two-party preferred numbers, and the Coalition appeared to surge ahead.\nThe simple truth is this: there is no clear mandate to govern, and there wonâ€™t be â€“ no matter which party eventually gets backed by the Independents, Green and WA National MPs. The reason? The Constitution is silent on the whole question. It doesnâ€™t say which set of numbers indicates a mandate to form government if a majority of 50% +1 isnâ€™t reached. As former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser said last night on QandA, convention dictates that all things being equal, the current Prime Minister should make the first attempt, but thatâ€™s all it is â€“ convention. State governments have wrestled with the question of minority governments, and the solutions have been as varied as the states themselves.\nBob Brown said it most succinctly â€“ the party who can get the most numbers after negotiating with the minor parties and Independents will form government. Thatâ€™s it.\nSo, whichever way this shakes down, neither the Coalition nor Labor will have any basis to claim they have a moral right bestowed upon them by the electorate. Not that this is likely to stop either of them. But itâ€™s worth remembering. As a people, Australia did not deliver a clear mandate to anyone. No amount of number-crunching or finger-pointing is going to change that.\nItâ€™s fairly important that the major parties not be allowed to forget that, either. In a perfect world, this might be an opportunity for them to learn some humility. Iâ€™m not that optimistic, but I do hope that it will at least be an occasion for some party room soul-searching.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\n1 Comment |\nPolitics | Tagged: Adam Bandt , ALP , Bob Katter , Coalition , Greens , hung parliament , Independents , Labor , Liberal Party , Rob Oakeshott , Tony Crook , Tony Windsor , vote |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nNeither messiahs norÂ upstarts\nAugust 30, 2010\nThe seat counting is all but finished, and it looks like shaking down into a dead heat between the major parties. Although the Coalition are still counting Tony Crook in their numbers, the new member for Oâ€™Connor has made it clear that he wants to be considered a cross-bench MP; given that, the Coalition canâ€™t realistically claim to be leading the count. Even if Crook does decide, in the end, to side with them, the presence of Adam Bandt â€“ who backs Labor â€“ evens out the number again. That leaves us exactly where we thought we would be; looking to four Independent MPs to decide who forms government, perhaps by the end of this week. And of course, everyone has an opinion about that.\nSome are delighted. To these people, this situation is a real opportunity to send a message to the major parties â€“ you donâ€™t get away with not listening to the people. All things are possible now, whether weâ€™re talking about changing the rules for Question Time, more say for backbenchers or reining in election advertising. At the very least, weâ€™ll see a change in the way things are done in Canberra. The Independents have a weighty responsibility, and are going about it in a sensible way. Itâ€™s up to the major parties to prove themselves capable of running a stable government.\nBut thereâ€™s also an interesting little vein of poison starting to run through public commentary as the days wear on. Who are these jumped-up backbenchers to decide our government, anyway? Most of us didnâ€™t vote for them, after all. How can we be disenfranchised like that? Are our votes worth nothing? What they should be doing is obeying the will of the people and falling into line behind the Coalition. Theyâ€™re ex-Nationals, after all, and what has Labor ever done for the bush? Why, even their own electorates want a Coalition rather than a Labor government. They should get off their high horses and stop grand-standing.\nReality check.\nKatter, Oakeshott, Windsor and Wilkie are not our saviours. They will not ride into Canberra on white horses (although Katter just might, you never know) and sweep away decades of convention with the righteous light of their convictions. At best they could get a dialogue going on matters of parliamentary reform, and if the major parties decide to band together against them, theyâ€™d be reduced to voices crying in the wilderness. After all, look at how effortlessly the Greens have been defeated in the Senate, over and over, on the issue of same-sex marriage.\nTheyâ€™re also not a â€˜messageâ€™ to anyone. The vagaries of the Australian political system put us in this situation, not some coordinated effort to spank the major parties. None of us went to the polls thinking, â€˜Aha, with my vote I will make them have to beg humbly for governmentâ€™. Some of us may have suspected that a hung Parliament was likely, but none of us were capable of orchestrating it. The result can certainly be read as Australia rejecting both major parties â€“ or at least failing to convince more than half the country that they were worthy of our votes. The Coalition doesnâ€™t believe that; theyâ€™re sticking to the line that the result is a resounding mandate for them to form government, and this Independent business is just an annoying hurdle to get over.\nAs for the discontented grumblings about disenfranchisement? We really should get over this idea that if the result isnâ€™t something we like, weâ€™ve been cheated. There are losers in every election; and yes, itâ€™s painful to watch a government whose ideology is the polar opposite of your own step into power. A good friend once called democracy â€˜the tyranny of the majorityâ€™, and itâ€™s a brutal â€“ but accurate â€“ description. Everyone has a voice, but itâ€™s the biggest number of people saying the same thing that get the prize.\nIf we voted formally on August 21, we made our voices heard. That we are now in a situation where there is no clear winner, and that we are now waiting for a handful of MPs to decide who to support, doesnâ€™t change that. In every election, it comes down to that. Usually, itâ€™s a few major party seats that hang in the balance. This time, those parties are sidelined. Itâ€™s not a case of too much power being vested in too few hands â€“ itâ€™s just that this time, theyâ€™re different hands.\nThen thereâ€™s the argument that the Independents are somehow obliged to crown the Coalition. Why? Because three of them are ex-Nationals? The operative word here is â€˜exâ€™ â€“ theyâ€™re not Nationals, and should not be expected to feel any residual loyalty. For that matter, no one should expect them to automatically reject the Coalition, either.\nWhat about the idea that the country electorates want them to back the Coalition? Well, letâ€™s have a look at that. This argument hinges on newspaper polls in the local media showing 50-60% support for the Coalition â€“ but these polls were available online. Anyone in Australia could vote in them, and skew the results. Thereâ€™s literally no way to tell how far the numbers reflect the feelings of the actual constituents. Those polls should rightly be tossed out.\nFinally, thereâ€™s the question of grand-standing. Are the Independents overreaching themselves in asking to be briefed by Treasury and various government departments? This is perhaps the sneakiest argument of all. Implicit in the accusation is the idea that these Independents have somehow â€˜forgotten their placeâ€™. They represent three country electorates, and theyâ€™re not even members of a political party; why donâ€™t they remember that and stop getting ideas above their station?\nAs the most vocal advocate of parliamentary reform, Rob Oakeshott has been the biggest target for those who subscribe to this idea. His calls for a unity government and for parliamentary and ministerial reform were soundly rubbished â€“ thereâ€™s a note of offence in the voices of the major parties,  and of patronising indulgence in the media when they reported on it. Now sure, he might be wildly idealistic, but there was a sense that he had no business talking about such things in the first place.\nWhy not? At what point did Oakeshott â€“ or any of us â€“ lose the right to criticise our parliamentary system, and suggest ideas for reform?\nThe accusations of â€˜grand-standingâ€™ have a nasty, unspoken corollary â€“ â€˜get back in your boxâ€™. Get out of the way and let the â€˜realâ€™ politicians get on with the business of government. Well, the â€˜realâ€™ politicians should probably take a step back and look at how well theyâ€™ve been doing so far â€“ and then perhaps start taking their situation seriously, instead of arguing which one of them has more right to rule.\nKatter, Oakeshott, Windsor and Wilkie are neither messiahs nor upstarts. They are elected representatives who find themselves in a position of incredible responsibility. And theyâ€™re taking it very seriously. In fact, Iâ€™d go so far as to say that in the last week, they have shown more integrity and commitment to the good of Australia as a whole than either Gillard or Abbott.\nFor this, they should be absolutely commended.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nEmail\nFacebook\nDigg\nReddit\nStumbleUpon\nPrint\nGoogle +1\nLinkedIn\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\n5 Comments |\nPolitics | Tagged: Adam Bandt , ALP , Andrew Wilkie , Bob Katter , Coalition , Greens , hung parliament , Independents , Labor , Liberal Party , Rob Oakeshott , Tony Crook , Tony Windsor |\nPermalink\nPosted by theconsciencevote\nÂ« Previous Entries\nSearch\nRecent Posts\nâ€˜Lâ€™ Plate Cabinet or Safe Pairs ofÂ Hands?\nAdoption â€“ a personalÂ perspective\nHonesty is its ownÂ punishment\nWhen is a knife not aÂ knife?\nMorrison and Nile â€“ itâ€™s just a lurch to theÂ right\nTwitter Updates\nMy niece thinks I\u0027m cool.

Partnerships help to bring in additional people and resources and expand the supporter base for gardens. \nCommunity gardens offer almost never-ending opportunities for learning across a wide range of areas and for \nputting knowledge and skills into practice. This makes them great â€˜outdoor classroomâ€™ venues for informal \nlearning, school-based learning, formal education and training courses, and lifelong learning. This resource offers \nsome tips to assist community gardens in building effective partnerships with education providers.  \nThe resource was informed by action research carried out for the Growing Communities WA project with Perth \nCity Farm from October 2009 to June 2010. It aims to complement other resources designed to assist gardens in \ndeveloping partnerships with schools. The resource is designed specifically for community self-managed gardens, \nbut may also be relevant to agency-managed and Local Council-managed. Whilst it draws on the experience of \ncommunity gardens in Western Australia in particular, most of the information and tips provided will be relevant \nfor community gardens anywhere. \nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS OF EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS \nEducation partnerships with community gardens can include provision of formal or informal learning \nopportunities. â€˜Informalâ€™ may be one-off workshops, courses without assessment, garden tours, childrenâ€™s \nsessions, arts sessions and so on. â€˜Formalâ€™ are accredited courses run through TAFE or other private education \nproviders. Learning opportunities can be for all age groups, abilities and backgrounds â€“ pre-school, school, teens, \nfamilies, adults, seniors, cross-cultural groups, or people living with mental health or disability issues. Partnerships \ncan generate a range of benefits for gardens and education providers. \nBENEFITS OF EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS (FOR GARDENS) \n Enables gardens to provide learning opportunities to specific target groups in the community \n Provides a way for gardens to focus on a particular project and get assistance with the development or \nimplementation of a project \n Brings new people (students, teachers) into the garden who may not otherwise engage with it \n Funds educational activities through the provision of lecturers, course coordinator hours, venue hire, catering \nand/or materials  \n Provides educational infrastructure such as course advertising, enrolment, assessment, certificates and \nstudent insurance \n Raises the profile of the garden with government bodies and other stakeholders in the community sector \n Provides healthy, flexible, sustainable, nurturing learning opportunities for all the community, including \nmarginalised groups and those who are disengaged from more traditional educational settings \n Enables gardens to educate their community on sustainable relevant topics such as composting, permaculture, \nfood security, vegetable gardening, organic methods, recycling, or photovoltaics. \n    \n \n \nPage5 \nBENEFITS OF COMMUNITY GARDEN PARTNERSHIPS (FOR EDUCATION PROVIDERS) \n Enables appropriate provision of flexible learning opportunities for marginalised groups and those who are \ndisengaged from more traditional educational settings \n Provides a conduit for the education provider to access and engage new target groups within the community  \n Provides a relevant and stimulating setting for courses in sustainability, arts, horticulture, landscaping, small \nbusiness enterprise or other cutting-edge topics \n Demonstrates an education providerâ€™s social and environmental consciousness \n Enables education providers to address literacy, numeracy and access issues in creative and effective ways \noutside a classroom setting \nTYPES OF EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES  \nThere are a number of different types of education partnership opportunities available to gardens. The following \nexamples drawn from the experience of Perth City Farm may be helpful in identifying education partnership \nopportunities for your garden. \n  \nOPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION EXAMPLES \nExisting short courses  \noffered at garden \n Courses on permaculture, worms, \ncomposting, sustainable lifestyles \n delivered by environmental groups, \ngarden staff, or TAFE staff  \n Permaculture sessions at City Farm \n Professional development days for teachers \nat City Farm \n \nStudent placements* \nat garden \n TAFE students working at garden on a \nproject of value to garden, under \nsupervision of garden staff / volunteers \nand with guidance from TAFE lecturer \n Colour Sound Harmony Peace Festival at City \nFarm \n Self-guided tour pamphlet for City Farm \n Nursery manual for City Farm \nTAFE courses focussed on a \nparticular project identified \nby the garden  \n \n Regular courses adapted to deliver in the \ncontext of a project of value to garden \n Literacy, numeracy and other \ncompetencies built into the course \n Funding obtained by TAFE \n Courses delivered at garden by TAFE \nstaff \n  NOW* course around an Organic Fruit and \nVegetable Box Project for City Farm \n GATE* course around a Menâ€™s Shed Project \nat City Farm \nHigh school students (16 yr \nolds) doing TAFE course* at \ngarden 1 day/per wk \n \n Students identified by high schools \n Course delivered by garden staff for TAFE \n Work/study in garden nursery \n Small construction projects  \n Some students choose to volunteer extra \ntime on other days for work experience \nTAFE students from garden \ninvolved in external projects \n Students gain extra experience through \ngarden partnership with other projects \n Garden/TAFE staff go offsite with \nstudents \n City Farm students to be involved at various \nstages with City Orchard being constructed \nat Perth Cultural Centre in Northbridge \nSchool programs  Short visits of 1-4 hours \n Organised by individual primary and high \nschool teachers  \n Garden tour or educational element \ndelivered by garden staff \n Tour on aspects of City Farm \n Topics linked to science or environment \ncurriculum areas \n Worm farms, biology of worms, growing \nthings, composting   \n \n \nPage6 \n* TAFE courses run at City Farm October 2009 â€“ June 2010: \n NOW - New Opportunities for Women (18 weeks) \n GATE â€“ Certificate I in Gaining Access to Training and Employment (8 weeks) \n High school students â€“ Certificate I in Horticulture and Certificate I in Construction \n TAFE placements â€“ from Certificates III and IV in Community Work (3-4 weeks), Diploma of Community \nServices â€˜Live Projectâ€™ (3 weeks), Diploma in Welfare Studies (300 hours)  \nCHOOSING PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES \nEducation providers increasingly see community gardens as useful and relevant settings for their programs. \nProviders may have responsibilities to provide flexible learning settings, engage marginalised participants, develop \nsustainable/environmental programs or provide community placements for their students. Gardens can be ideal \nsettings to meet all of these goals, but at times it may not necessarily be in the best interests of gardens to enter \ninto education partnerships. Partnership activities need to be a suitable fit for the timing, resources, structures and \ncurrent goals of the garden. In order to help your garden sift through the various opportunities and make good \ndecisions about which to take up, itâ€™s useful to have some processes in place for weighing up the options: \n A checklist to help decide whether the conditions for an effective partnership exist (see Conditions for \nEffective Education Partnerships section for ideas) \n An agreement amongst members of the garden as to how final decisions about entering into partnerships are \nmade (who makes the decision? who is accountable? who makes it happen?) \n Clarity about expectations, roles and responsibilities of the partnership members \n Willingness and strength to say â€˜noâ€™ to partnership opportunities when necessary \n  \nExternal grants for facilities \ntied to educational \noutcomes \n Garden is funded to build/ purchase an \nasset \n Garden arranges for courses to provide \nemployment and training outcomes from \nthe asset \n City Farm CafÃ© built and equipped by large \nFederal Government grant with proviso that \ngarden organises TAFE and/or private \nprovider to deliver training in hospitality, \nbusiness and employability skills \nDisability groups  Partner organisation provides transport, \ncarers, activities \n Delivery by partner staff and/or garden \nstaff \n Regular weekly group from Nulsen Haven \nattend art-based program working on \nmosaic tiles and colourful vegetable box \ngardens  \nEducational opportunities \nwith business and \ncommunity links \n  \n Links with service clubs, businesses, \ncultural groups, or health services \nprovide valuable learning opportunities  \n Annual rotary club breakfast at City Farm \nwith garden speaker \n Gull staff day out on â€˜Sustainable Quizâ€™ with \nstops at City Farm and other sustainable \ncontexts \n Mental health agency participants in courses \nand projects \nFestivals  Run on a theme or topic \n Group uses/hires garden venue \n Provide creative and vibrant learning \nopportunities \n Bring public into contact with garden and \nsustainable issues \n Raises funds \n Eco Fairy Festival at City farm in partnership \nwith Eco Fairy team \n The Great Re-skilling Day at City Farm in \npartnership with Permaculture Association \nof WA   \n \n \nPage7 \nCONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS   \n There is a good relationship with one or more key people in the partner organisation, with a shared interest \nand excitement, to generate specific opportunities.  \n \n Gardens see the value that theyâ€™re offering and are able to demonstrate this value to potential partnerships \nthrough: feedback received from garden members, previous students at the garden or existing partner \norganisations; photos; local newspaper articles; and garden newsletter items. \n \n Gardens see themselves as equal in the partnership, not taking a passive role in relation to partner and instead \nbeing proactive where appropriate. \n \n There is recognition and acknowledgement of any differences in the contexts that the partners work within \n(i.e. if partners come from the government or private sectors there is likely to be differences between them \nand gardens in terms of areas of skills and knowledge, resources, priorities, timelines and so on) and \nacknowledgement of the skills and positives contributed by both sides. \n \n Agreed and effective communication processes are put in place such as: alternate chairing of meetings; use of \npreferred contacts e.g. email, landline or mobile; and inclusion of all key players in the exchange of \ninformation. \n \n Both partner organisations see that thereâ€™s clearly something of value for them in the partnership and both \nare clear on the purpose and approach to be taken.  \n \n Other members or groups within the garden are kept aware of the nature and progress of the partnership, to \nmaintain overall garden support and interest in whatâ€™s happening. \n \n Itâ€™s vital to have a connection with someone in the education organisation who listens, is prepared to \nadvocate for and be an ally within their organisation and who has a flexible approach. Youâ€™ll recognise these \npeople because they: make it happen at their respective levels; are keen; are community people at heart; have \na genuine interest in the community garden; are open to the community approach; and are able to take \npotential and put it into action. \n \n The garden has the systems and people in place to be able to deliver the agreed partnership outcomes. \n \n There is regular feedback between partners about the progress, glitches, achievements and next steps for the \npartnership. \nOTHER TIPS FOR BUILDING STRONG PARTNERSHIPS \n It takes a reasonable amount of time and a strong commitment to make partnerships work. \n \n Have projects in mind of various size and content so that, when an opportunity arises for a learning \npartnership, some of the thinking and planning has already been done. \n \n \n   \n \n \nPage8 \n Find ways to embed partnership arrangements so that they can live on after individual staff, for example:  \nï‚§ Document agreed ways of working together (e.g. protocols) \nï‚§ Develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlining the roles and responsibilities of project \npartners in relation to specific projects \nï‚§ Keep a record of specific strategies and structures that have worked well \n \n Keep evidence of successes and of how they were achieved through photos, email exchanges, flyers, \nnewsletter articles \n \n Start with small initiatives and build up to bigger ventures \n \n Set initial partnerships up as â€˜pilotsâ€™; that way, if it doesnâ€™t work out you wonâ€™t feel like a failure and you arenâ€™t \nseen as a failure \n \n Establish timelines / deadlines as early as you can (your own and theirs) \n \n Involve and inform other garden members at all stages of the partnership to avoid treading on anyoneâ€™s \nâ€˜patchâ€™ and to ensure their support \nCHECKLIST OF THINGS TO WORK OUT WHEN NEGOTIATING A NEW PARTNERSHIP \n Whatâ€™s the project? \n Is there sufficient lead-in time to negotiate an effective partnership? \n Whatâ€™s the benefit for the garden? \n Whatâ€™s the resourcing / input required by the garden (in terms of staff time and financial resources)? \n What is each partner contributing? \nï‚§ Who will do what? \nï‚§ Who will pay for what (e.g. insurance, phone calls, photocopying) \n Who are the students? What is the nature of their study, skills, communication, interest and/or attitude? \n What are the skills of the lecturer and will they be flexible enough for a community garden setting? \n Who, within the garden, will be responsible for managing the partnership? \nTHE INTERSECTION BETWEEN STUDENTS AND GARDEN MEMBERS/VOLUNTEERS \nEach community garden has its own unique culture, history and approach. Gardens are flexible, community-based \noutdoor spaces with varying levels of access by the general public, large volunteer input, practical rules and \nminimal formal procedures. Students may come from TAFE settings, schools, mental health agencies, corrective \nservices, migrant settlement agencies, seniors groups, service clubs or simply arrive off the street. Given the lack of \nformal policies, procedures and structures in most garden settings, there is room for misunderstandings, \ninappropriate responses and challenging situations to arise within or between garden groups and individuals. Here \nare some suggestions that your garden could put in place when considering an educational partnership: \n Identify, record and prepare for risks involved in any program at the outset. â€˜Risksâ€™ may be occupational, \nhealth, safety, financial, emotional, or reputation related. \n \n Ensure all students take part in an orientation session, which clarifies the values and approach of the garden, \nthe expectations of students and the appropriate lines of communication and support.    \n \n \nPage9 \n Develop a Code of Conduct to be signed by students which could include: \nï‚§ Respect, tolerance and acceptance of others \nï‚§ Use of appropriate language and humour towards others \nï‚§ Use of any garden computers, phones or other equipment only for project, study and/or garden \npurposes \nï‚§ Appropriate dress code (OH\u0026S, professionalism and/or public space issues) \nï‚§ A breakdown of garden values into practical points or examples \n \n Ensure lecturers, garden staff and agency personnel have all discussed and agreed on strategies for formal or \ninformal screening of students, appropriate supports in place, and consistency of responses to inappropriate \nbehaviour. \n  ",

The first day of the meeting focused on the results of the captive breeding program.\nAll the people involved in captive breeding gave an update on the results of the last breeding season. The great news is that we had successful breeding in almost all of the breeding facilities and much more success overall than previous years.\nTidbinbilla Nature Reserveâ€™s northern corroboree frogs produced 442 eggs and Taronga Zoo has 143 southern corroboree frog tadpoles and 270 northern corroboree frog tadpoles swimming around.\nOver the coming months it will be exciting to watch the tadpoles change into little corroboree frogs.\nUnfortunately we also had a few set-backs with frogs getting sick and temperature control problems. We have identified the cause of much of the illness in the frogs and have made changes to the facilities to fix these. We are also installing better temperature control systems in some of the facilities and high-tech temperature alarm systems to prevent any more of these problems in the future.\nThanks to the teamwork of all the captive breeding facilities - Taronga Zoo, Amphibian Research Centre, Melbourne Zoo, Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve and Healesville Sanctuary â€“ we are excited about the wonderful progress we are making in saving this important species!\nÂ  Â \nVisit the movies and help Corroboree Frogs\nJanuary 2010\nThe Princess and the Frog Movie Promo.\nThe Murray CMA and Regent Cinemas, Albury are promoting the plight of the Corroboree Frog over the next two weeks to coincide with screenings of the new Disney movie The Princess and The Frog.\nGo to http://www.regentcinemas.com.au/ to enter our competition to win free movie tickets and go in the draw for the grand prize of a \u0027Behind the Scenes\u0027 tour of Taronga Zoo\u0027s Corroboree frog breeding program with Taronga zookeeper Michael McFadden.\nEveryone that buys tickets to The Princess and the Frog will also receive a free Corroboree Frog sticker.\nÂ  Â \nFrogs in Schools\nSeptember 2009\nStudent with frogs.\nGerry Marantelli of the Amphibian Research Centre.\nStudents at sixteen schools in the Murray Catchment had the opportunity to get up-close with Corroboree Frogs, and lots of other frogs from the local area, at Frog Education days held in September.\nGerry Marantelli, of the Amphibian Research Centre in Melbourne, visited schools with an entourage of frogs for students to see, touch and feed.Â  Gerry also talked to students about the many superpowers of frogs from across the world, including the frog that can freeze solid and come back to life when it thaws, and the most poisonous animal in the world - the poison dart-frog of South America.\nAll the students were fascinated by Gerry\u0027s stories and we hope are inspired to help us stop the decline and extinction of more of the worldsâ€™ wonderful frogs.\nÂ  Â \nBreeding Success at Tidbinbilla\nAugust 2009\nDr Murray Evans in one of the temperature-controlled breeding enclosures at Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.\nNorthern Corroboree Frog.\nThe gang at Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve in the ACT has had a major breakthrough in the captive breeding program of Corroboree Frogs.Â  During the last breeding season their Northern Corroboree Frogs produced close to 1,500 eggs or an average of 6 eggs per female. This is by far the best breeding success we\u0027ve had with either of the Corroboree Frog species and gives us lots of hope for the future.\nCorroboree frogs can\u0027t breed until they are about four years old, and breeding success improves as they get older with older females appearing to produce much more eggs. Because of this only frogs that were collected as eggs from the wild over 5 years ago are breeding. On top of this we have had lots of problems with eggs and tadpoles not surviving to frog stage.\nThe reason for the last season\u0027s success at Tidbinbilla is still not really known. Dr Murray Evans - Senior Wildlife Ecologist with the ACT Government has developed a temperature regime for the captive frogs that he believes might be part of the reason. The regime mimics the conditions the frogs would have in their natural environment and involves cooling the frogs down to 5Â°C for a short Winter and a longer Summer at 20Â°C to allow the frogs to grow and develop eggs.\nDuring the next breeding season Murray and his team at Tidbinbilla will be looking extra closely at the temperature regime, and a range of other factors, to see if they can find the secret to their success.\nÂ  Â \nMore Articles...\nIVF for Corroboree Frogs\nAdopters needed!\nMurray Now gets on board as a sponsor\nProgram Launch!\nPage 1 of 2\n\u003c\u003c Start \u003c Prev 1 2 Next \u003e End \u003e\u003e\nHome\nDonate\nCorroboree Frog\nShow Your Support\nMore Information\nNews \u0026 Updates\nIn The Media\nContact Us\n",

There are resources inside this particular article regarding what sound books are details like the difference between abridged plus unabridged plus codecsShooter by Capt Casey Kuhlman AudioBook information\nWorld War II, or the Second World War (often abbreviated WWII or WW2), was a global military conflict which involved a majority of the world\u0027s nations, including all of the great powers, organised into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The war involved the mobilisation of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history. In a state of \"total war\", the major participants placed their complete economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Over seventy million people, the majority of them civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.\nThe start of the war is generally held to be in September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland and subsequent declarations of war on Nazi Germany by the British Commonwealth and France. Many belligerents entered the war before or after this date, during a period which spanned from 1937 to 1941, as a result of other events. Amongst these main events are the Marco Polo Bridge Incident (fought between Nationalist China and Japan), the start of Operation Barbarossa (the Nazi invasion of Russia), and the attacks on Pearl Harbor and British and Dutch colonies in South East Asia. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as the world\u0027s superpowers. This set the stage for the Cold War, which lasted for the next 45 years. The United Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict. The self-determination spawned by the war accelerated decolonisation movements in Asia and Africa, while Western Europe itself began moving toward integration.\nIn the aftermath of World War I, a defeated Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles.This caused Germany to lose a significant portion of its territory, prohibited the annexation of other states, limited the size of German armed forces and imposed massive reparations. Russia\u0027s civil war led to the creation of the Soviet Union which soon was under the control of Joseph Stalin. In Italy, Benito Mussolini seized power as a fascist dictator promising to create a \"New Roman Empire.\"The Kuomintang (KMT) party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese communist allies. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Japanese Empire, which had long sought influence in China[8] as the first step of its right to rule Asia, used the Mukden Incident as justification to invade Manchuria; the two nations then fought several small conflicts, in Shanghai, Rehe and Hebei until the Tanggu Truce in 1933. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan.\nAdolf Hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923, became the leader of Germany in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a radical racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearming campaign.[9] This worried France and the United Kingdom, who had lost much in the previous war, as well as Italy, which saw its territorial ambitions threatened by those of Germany.[10] To secure its alliance, the French allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired to conquer. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Saarland was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, speeding up remilitarisation and introducing conscription. Hoping to contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front. The Soviet Union, concerned due to Germany\u0027s goals of capturing vast areas of eastern Europe, concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with France.\nBefore taking effect though, the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, rendering it essentially toothless and in June 1935, the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany easing prior restrictions. The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August. In October, Italy invaded Ethiopia, with Germany the only major European nation supporting her invasion. Italy then revoked objections to Germany\u0027s goal of making Austria a satellite state.In direct violation of the Versailles and Locarno treaties, Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland in March 1936. He received little response from other European powers.[15] When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July, Hitler and Mussolini supported fascist GeneralÃƒÂ­simo Francisco Franco\u0027s nationalist forces in his civil war against the Soviet-supported Spanish Republic. Both sides used the conflict to test new weapons and methods of warfare and the nationalists would prove victorious in early 1939.\nWith tensions mounting, efforts to strengthen or consolidate power were made. In October, Germany and Italy formed the Rome-Berlin Axis and a month later Germany and Japan, each believing communism and the Soviet Union in particular to be a threat, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy would join in the following year. In China, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose Japan.\nÂ \nright-menu\nHannah Montana Books\nCookbooks from Celebrity Chefs and Favourite Cooks\nDoreen Virtue AudioBooks\nScience Fiction Books\nCaroline Myss Audio CDs\nEckhart Tolle AudioBook CDs\nAnthony Robbins Audio Book CDs\nDr Wayne Dyer Audio Book CDs\nLouise Hay Audio CDs\nGough Whitlam Books for Christmas\nHousemeeting by Lano and Woodley\nLittle Golden Books\nObernewtyn Chronicles Books\nWheel of Time Books\nLearn Greek Language\nLearn the French Language\nChristopher Paolini Books\nArtemis Fowl Series\nClassic fiction on AudioBook\nMindfulness - Jon Kabat-Zinn Audio\nShakespeare Plays on Audio CD\nEmily Rodda Childrens Books\nSales and Selling Audio CD\nDeepak Chopra Audio CD\nPamela Lofts Books\nWealth Money Audio\nAustralian Politics Books\nNLP Neuro Linguistic Programing\nChristmas books\nJeannette Rowe childrens books\nSelf-Sufficiency books\nWeight Loss Audio\nMindfulness - Jon Kabat-Zinn Audio\nWhispers Relaxation CDs\nToyota Manuals\nYoga Fitness\nQuit Smoking\nLearn Arabic\nAudio Italian\nVampire Fiction\nBob Hawke Books\nLearn Japanese\nAudioBooks\nAudioBooks Biography\nSimonette Vaja\nMercesdes Benz repair\nParenting\nHyundai repair\nBox Set Kids Books\nExtra Info\nChristmas Bookshop has some great christmas present ideas.

As with windsurfing the development in Kite Technology since its conception has been incredibly fast. Today it is very achievable to cover a huge range of conditions with only two wings and one board, and for those with limited stowage space or a small set of wheels, this sport is for you!  Deflated kites stow neatly into a back pack size bag and are easy to hide so your partner need not even know that you are now a Kitesurfer!!!!\nKite surfing looks and feels cool....it maybe even looks very difficult when in fact Kitesurfing is surprisingly easy to master and progression to intermediate level is incredibly fast for most. Kitesurfing has the benefit of providing maximum enjoyment in relatively light winds, hence providing a wider window of potential high scoring water time.\nThere is no doubt that this sport is visually intriguing and exciting and is the water sport that raises the most questions on the beach from onlookers. There is just something about a person hanging off the bottom of a parachute style kite dangling 10 meters above sea level, throwing an a hand full of airborne loops and twists only to land like a feather on the water surface planning away slicing a neat groove in the ocean.\nAs with all the products and activities on this web site you must be warned; these sports are incredibly addictive!\nStay tuned to News and events to hook into the regular road trips along the South Coast and Port Philip Bay.\nFor more information contact team@coreboardsports.com\nOr to book an introductory lesson contact stoked@coreboardsports.com\nProduct Links\nUseful Links\nBOM - Bass Strait and approaches Forecast\nBAYWINDS - Port Phillip Winds and Temperatures\nMagic Seaweed\nWind \u0026 Swell\nWARNING!

The Compassionate Friends Victoria Inc. has once \nagain enjoyed another fruitful year. The essence of our  \norganisation is Mutual Self Help, Peer Support; our large number of \ncommitted volunteers, qualify this. This dedicated band of people \ncontributes so many hours of their own time to ensure that The \nCompassionate Friends fulfils its objectives. It is our members, who \nhave suffered such a tragic loss, â€˜Understand as perhaps few  \nothers canâ€œ how devastating this can be. Yet through their grief, \nthey are ready, willing and able to offer the hand of compassion, \nunderstanding and friendship to other bereaved parents,  \ngrandparents and siblings. \n \nIn recognising their outstanding contribution to The Compassionate \nFriends, the Rhys Harmer Award is presented to retired Volunteers \nwho have provided such wonderful support.  In 2011 the award \nwas presented to a truly worthy recipient, Norm Wearne. Norm \u0026 \nRuth first made contact with The Compassionate Friends in March \n1995, just 2 weeks after the death of their second son, Stephen \nwho was 28 years old. Glenda, their second daughter had died \naged 18 months in 1964 from an illness. (At this time, of course, \nthere was no organisation called The Compassionate Friends.) \nNorm started as a Centre volunteer in 1996 from which he retired \nin December 2005. During these ten years he supported us in \nmany different ways. He provided much needed administration \nsupport to the Centre. He participated in training courses which \nqualified him to answer the phones â€“ not just in the office, but for \nmany years on The Compassionate Friends  after-hours roster. \nNorm also became involved with the newsletter team (later to be \nrenamed the Magazine) helping to choose articles for  \nconsideration, as well as using his special talent for proof-reading. \nThis he did with great accuracy until 2009. \n \nIn the last few years the Board has been proactive in reviewing not \nonly our business strategy but by evaluating the operation of the \nBoard itself.  In January we held a Board Reflection and Review \nday where we were able to review the operation of the Board to \nensure that the Board continues to function effectively and perform \nefficiently to meet the expectations of our members, staff and \nstakeholders. The initiative of having these Board working days \nhas certainly been fruitful and worthwhile. It has enabled us to do a \nself-analysis on how we deliver appropriate, correct and ethical \ngovernance to The Compassionate Friends Victoria. \n \nThe experience and diversity of the board has worked well to  \nprovide good stable governance and leadership to The  \nCompassionate Friends ensuring that our organisation continues to \nfunction and carry out our responsibilities to the satisfaction of our \nmembers. During this year we have seen some changes to the \nmake up of the board; I wish to thank retiring members Kieran \nWitts, Aparna Agrawal and Helen McKebery for their contribution to \nthe efficient operation of the Board. In June 2012 the board  \nconsists of Vice President, Anne Edwards; Secretary, Sue Beale; \nTreasurer, Danny Bendel; along with Tony Gee, Theresa Yeo, Jan \nMcNess, Andrew Weatherhead and Dorothy Ford.  \n \nThe Compassionate Employer Recognition Awards were presented \nin March. For the 9\nth\n year the Rotary Club of Geelong Central has \nbeen our partner for these awards. This year we were again  \nprivileged to have our Patron Dr Rhonda Galbally AO, present the \nawards and for the first time the Parliamentary Secretary for Health \nMr Nick Wakeling providing a  key note speech. The 18  \norganisations deserve public recognition for being positive role \nmodels in assisting an employee through the trauma and impact \nfollowing the death of a close loved one. At this event we  \nintroduced an Awards logo so that recipients can proudly display it \non their correspondence or website. The Compassionate Friends \nare delighted to announce that the Stafford Group is our principal \nsponsor for the Compassionate Employer Recognition Awards in \n2013 and that the Rotary Club of Geelong Central will again  \npartner us. \n \nThe Board has been active in pursuing the aims and objectives of \nThe Compassionate Friends This last year we have continued to \nsupport members and volunteers alike. The highlights of the  \n2011-2012 year are many and varied; I will however give some  \nexamples of the years highlights. \n \nPRESIDENT â€™S REPORT \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOur social and grief sharing support groups play such an  \nimportant role to our members. Regional and metropolitan \ngroup visits continued through the year and with very positive \nfeedback from Group Facilitators. \n \nCommencement of the ACORN Time Out Research and \nEvaluation project, offering a retreat services for members.  \n \nThrough Pilotlightâ€™s support we received funding from Coopers \nInvestments and Andyinc to continue the Outreach Peer  \nSupport Service. \n \nAn important event for our members is the Annual â€˜Walk to  \nRememberâ€™ this year over 150 people attended to remember \nour children and siblings in a healthy caring and comforting \nway. \n \nDevelopment of a Resource Action Group to investigate  \nincome generation. \n \nGroup leader training redeveloped now in alignment with  \nLifeline Australiaâ€™s Suicide Bereavement Support Group  \nStandards \u0026 Practice. \n \nWe commenced a review of all training by The Compassionate \nFriends \n \nFollowing the success of the â€˜Walking Alone Togetherâ€™  \nresidential retreat in 2010, a committee was established for the \n2012 â€˜Grieve Heal \u0026 Grow Togetherâ€™ gathering.  \n \nI would like to acknowledge the contribution of our many  \nfundraisers and supporters. This year The Compassionate \nFriends is particularly grateful to our key funders, including the \nDepartment of Health Mental Health Branch, PDRSS- MSSH; \nLord Mayorâ€™s Charitable Foundation, Coopers Investments, \nAndyinc, Working Dog, Stafford Group and Deloittes The  \nNational Mental Health Council \u0026 William Angliss Foundation.; \nOur devoted Chief Executive Anne Wicking and her dedicated \nstaff deserve recognition for the well-organized functioning of \nThe Compassionate Friends Bereavement Centre and the  \nefficient operation of our organisation as a whole. A special \nthank you to Dr Ronda Galbally AO, our esteemed patron, for \nher ongoing inspiration and commitment to The  \nCompassionate Friends Victoria. \n \nLooking to the future we have a commitment to further improve \nthe operation and delivery of services to members of The \nCompassionate Friends Victoria. \n \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bradley \nPresident. \nSandra Green, Daniel Bendel, Desley Bresley Margaret Graham \u0026 John \nBradley President receiving Lord Mayors Trust Foundation Certificates \n   CEO Report  \n \nThroughout this report, you will see that 2011/12 has been another busy year in supporting bereaved parents, siblings and grandparents following the tragic death of their children,  \nbrothers and sisters and grandchildren.  With many firsts and many continued programs that all provide HOPE to our families we continue to be inspired by their strength and resilience \nfor which they so generously share with others through our peer support services.  You will see Lindyâ€™s Story on this page, her story is reflective of the many volunteers and bereaved \nparents we support.  It captures the difficult journey and highlights the courage and resilience displayed by so many familiesâ€”it continues to be our Vision that we provide a safe and \nsupportive space where we can reduce the social isolation and often dislocation from community  - â€˜we need not walk aloneâ€™.. \n \n \nThis year we have added to our website a number of our family stories to share with \nthe broader community to give hope and inspiration that there is a pathway through \nthe crippling and overwhelming grief experience.  With over 56,000 Visits to our \nwebsite it is increasingly becoming a platform where people will make connection.  \nTo this end we have also become a community partner with Healthshare , an  \ninteractive website and we are in the process of developing Facebook pages for \nboth Siblings and the TCF website.   \n \nWe have been fortunate to launch a new service to families â€œTime Outâ€ this is a \ncollaboration between the ACORN Foundation and TCF to deliver respite retreats, \nin itâ€™s pilot phase we have been speaking with our members to seek their input on \nwhat they would find helpful in offering such a service.      \n \nBehind the scenes we continue to work on projects that we can see as supporting \nfamilies our valued volunteers and staff.  We have initiated a Training Review  \nCommittee to ensure that our training to Volunteers continues to reflect professional \nquality and high standards.  To this end we have for the first time in 2012 run the \nGroup Leader Training which is now in alignment with the nationally accredited \nLifeline Suicide Bereavement Support Group Guidelines.  We have also  \ncommenced a Resource Action Group where we have invited several of our key \nsupporters to consult with us on our future strategies for income and funds  \ndiversification. Our Gathering 2012 Committee has been in full swing for the past 12 \nmonths gearing up for the Gathering in October. This our 2nd Gathering  â€œGrieve \nHeal \u0026 Grow Togetherâ€ is shaping up to be a wonderful 2 1/2 day event. \n \nSince our move to 173, we have been deliberating as to what we placed on the wall \ndirectly in front of the door.  Originally the wall was purpose  built to house the  \nhonour board with the names of many of the families children.  This was felt to be \ntoo overwhelming and confronting.  We are delighted that adorning this wall today is \nan artwork commissioned to reflect the journey of hope painted by Jodie Cooper a \nwonderful supporter of TCF and donated and unveiled in September 2011 by Mayor \nNick Tragas.  The piece titled â€œUnited Journeyâ€ represents hope and continuing bonds.  I would also like to acknowledge and thank Mr Nick Wakeling, MP Parliamentary Secretary for \nHealth, Dr Rhonda Galbally our Patron and Mr Lloyd Gosling, President of the Rotary Club of Geelong Centralâ€”our Partners for the Compassionate Employer Recognition Awards for \ntheir inspirational speeches at this years awards. \n \nIn November last year, Deloitteâ€™s approached us to be part of the â€œImpact Dayâ€ where all their staff provide their time in supporting charitable causes.  We were afforded the opportunity \nto spend the day with four of their team who gave their valued expertise on some of our operations.  The incredible staff members have continued to support us following this day and \nhave given of their own time to add value to the work we do.  \n \nIn April 2012 the State Government announced through publishing a consultation paper its intent to reform the  Psychiatric Disability Rehabilitation and Support services.  As a result of \nthis a lot of time has been spent by the Board and CEO in understanding and responding to the consultation paper in relation to the impact this may have the families we support.  We \nunderstand that there will be a specific separate review of Mutual Support Self Help funded agencies.  The Compassionate Friends developed and submitted a written response to the \npaper and also in conjunction with seven other statewide specialist MSSH providers submitted a joint response paper. We understand the reform will occur in stages over the next \ntwelve months to two years and TCF will ensure that the needs of bereaved parents, siblings and grandparents are  highlighted at every possible opportunity. \n \n \n \nAs CEO I have continued to represent the organisation on several Reference Groups and Taskforces including the MSSH \nRepresentative of the VicServ Policy Advisory Group, Member of the Executive of the Victorian Bereavement Support Net-\nwork, VicServ Representative on the Mental Health Advisory Line Stakeholder Reference Group, and on the reference group \nfor research into End of Life Decisions.  I  continue to act as co-ordinator of the MSSH Network represent TCF as one of the \npartnerâ€™s in the Centre for Excellence in Peer Support.  We have started planning with Lifeline and Support After Suicide â€œItâ€™s \nOK to Talk About Suicideâ€ Community Awareness Walk later in 2012.   We have been invited to attend a number of forums to \ndiscuss Suicide Prevention and Postvention and to be included in Federal forums conducted by local members. \n \nThe Board of Management has spent considerable time reviewing our Strategic Directions and we are in the process of de-\nveloping the 2012â€“ 2015 Business Strategy Development Plan. The evolution of the organisation and future directions as \nalways are informed by the membership and their needs. \n \nThe work of this organisation occurs due to the dedication of our volunteers. In 11/12 165 Volunteers contributed more than \n7,900 hours handling 8,300 phone calls to the centre \u0026 after hours handling a range of enquiries \u0026 support calls and running \nover 280 support groups with more than 1,900 attending those support group the wonderful volunteer team who provide our \ncommunity education programs and produce our  Magazine and Siblings Newsletter. How can we thank them for without \ntheir support we simply could not function.   \n \nThe staff at TCF: Sue, Andrew,  Paul, Josie  and Jenny consistently go beyond to ensure that the families we support are \nprovided with the best we can offerâ€”they exemplify passion, care and compassion to each and every volunteer and family.. \nThe Board of Management,  who guide the organisation every step of the way: John Bradley our esteemed  \nPresident, Theresa Yeo, Tony Gee,  Sue Beale, Daniel Bendel, Helen McKebery,  Aparna Agrawal, Anne Edwards, Kieran \nWitts, Jan McNess, and our newest members Dorothy Ford and Andrew Weatherhead thank you.  \n \n \n \n \nOur organisation is privileged to be able to provide peer support to many families going through the intense grief journeyâ€”no one needs to walk alone and with the dedication of those \nwho have travelled the road before ensures that  no one does. \n \n \n \n \nAnne Wicking \nCEO \n \nCEO REPORT \n \nLindyâ€™s Story \nâ€œIt is finding a place where you can try and participate again \nin life when you are struggling to keep going and where just \ngetting out of bed every day can be a victory.â€ \n \nAfter you lose a child life hurts. If youâ€™re lucky you have a good supportive \nnetwork of family and friends who can stand by you as you try and \nsurvive. But even the best intentioned people around you donâ€™t \nunderstand and can be thoughtless and unwittingly increase the sense of \nprofound isolation you feel.  \n \nWhen as a bereaved parent you discover The Compassionate Friends \nyou suddenly realise that you are not alone; that there are people who \nreally do understand, who have walked in the same shoes you are \nwearing. The bond that develops between people who are going through \nor have gone through something similar to yourself is deep and real. \nLaughter and tears flow freely as stories are told and a feeling of re-\nconnection to the world begins as the pain of the present is shared along with the joy of the memories \nof our lost children. \n \nTo be a volunteer with The Compassionate Friends in Victoria is to walk through the front door of the \ncentre in Balwyn and be greeted by the coordinator who smiles warmly and welcomes you with a \nhug. It is getting to know other bereaved parents who have tragic and pain-filled stories all of us \ndifferent and yet united by our shared loss of our precious child. It is finding a place where you can \ntry and participate again in life when you are struggling to keep going and where just getting out of \nbed every day can be a victory. In the warmth and acceptance of The Compassionate Friends \nenvironment you begin to find some meaning and purpose again as other peopleâ€™s stories and \ncourage inspire you to hope again.  \n \nLindy bereaved mother of Ben \nâ€œUnited Journeyâ€ \nBen  Co-ordinators Volunteers  \n(Centre \u0026 Telephone) Report \n \nThe Compassionate Friends Victoria Volunteer Workforce: \n \n \nOnce again, my sincere thanks go to our hardworking Volunteers, who so unselfishly  \ndonate, not only their time and physical energy, but also their emotional energy. This show \nof caring and support is given to each other as well as the many bereaved families who \nmake contact with us. Some of these contacts can be on a regular basis until they feel \nthey are able to manage, to a certain degree the tragedy that has befallen them. For these \nmembers, it is our caring Volunteers who play such a big role, with their continuing  \nsupport, to help those on their grief journey. Our organisation would not be able to run as \neffectively or as efficiently as it does, without their amazing help and support, \n \nIn recognition of Volunteer Week, and to show appreciation to our Volunteers, a â€˜Movie \nLuncheonâ€™ was organised. Approximately 38 Volunteers attended, meeting before the \nmovie to enjoy a coffee and chat, and then following the movie we enjoyed a light lunch. \nOverall this is a very enjoyable day for the Volunteers and staff, who are able to attend. It \nis a lovely opportunity to see each other in a social capacity, allowing all to mingle, catch \nup and chat with they know whilst meeting new Volunteers they may not know.      \n \nTo list just some of the tasks performed by our Volunteers at the Centre whilst the tasks \nvary, they include general office duties, receiving phone calls from fellow bereaved  \nparents and others seeking support from the newly bereaved. Others seeking support may \ninclude professional, students, hospitals etc; requiring information on TCF. Other duties \ninclude database, receipting payments, anniversary cards and thank you letters as well as \nprojects given to Volunteers that may include updating and maintaining manuals, collating \nstatistics, (which are vital for the organisation) and corresponding with other organisations. \n \nA very large commitment also by the Volunteers is in the writing and mailing of the very \nimportant anniversary cards. Just over 2000 anniversary cards have been sent this  \nfinancial year, and these cards are written with genuine care, empathy and compassion, \nand are written by only a few of our Volunteers, due to the sensitive nature of the duty. \n       \nI would also like to thank our wonderful Volunteers who take the After Hours phone,  \nensuring that TCF continues to offer a 24hrs phone service. Every month on a rotating \nroster, an A/H trained supervisor is assigned, should the Volunteer need to de-brief, due \nto upsetting or difficult call. Contact is made the following morning after their shift, to  \ncollect any new memberâ€™s details and to monitor amount of calls. All calls are logged for \nstatistics, but no personal and confidential details are recorded for the statistics. \n \nSince I started in this position, almost five years ago, I have managed to maintain a  \nuser-friendly office and filing system, making it easier for all concerned. I have continued \nthe ongoing training of the Volunteers, so that the majority are now able to approach their \ntasks with confidence and a sense of achievement. I have managed to have both the  \nCentre and A/Hours rosters filled even at times where many members were absent, either \ndue to travelling or illness. We have had many new Volunteers commence this year,  \nincluding six telephoned trained Volunteers. There are now, at least six Centre  \nCoordinator-trained Volunteers, who are able to â€˜fill inâ€™ should there be an emergency or to \ncover sick and annual leave or if either Andrew or I are on a training day. \n \nFour separate Volunteer Information Days are held throughout the year, to encourage new \nVolunteers, who have passed the first anniversary of the loss of their loved one. This is \nopen to both parents, siblings and grandparents, who feel they are ready to â€˜giveâ€™ a little, \nin whatever capacity or role they choose to take.  On these particular information days, \nwhilst not many attend on one particular day, it is approximately 12 annually that attend \nand are able to offer their help. As our Information Days may not  always be set at the \nâ€˜right timeâ€™ some of our members also come into the Centre when they are â€˜readyâ€™ to give \nof their time and experience, and feel ready to Volunteer.   \n \n \nBulletin: \n \nA Volunteer Bulletin is sent out bi-monthly to all our 165 Volunteers, so that they may be \ninformed of whatâ€™s happening not only in the Centre and with the organisation, but keep \ninformed of any upcoming events, workshops or seminars, that may be of interest to them. \nThe bulletin also is a way of being updated with other Volunteers and what they are doing. \nThis may include personal interest stories of holidays, family events or any news they wish \nto share with each other on a larger scale. \n \n \nSeminars and Workshops: \n \nOver the last 12months we offered our Volunteers the opportunity of attending various Self \nDevelopment workshops, which included \n Meeting With Kirrily (medium)â€¦â€¦â€¦....28 participants \n De Clutter Your Mindâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦14 Participants \n Scrapbooking..........................................8  Participants \n Watercolourâ€¦........................................10 Participants \n \nThese days were generally well attended, and this also gives an opportunity for  \nVolunteers to mix and learn together in a friendly, fun and relaxed atmosphere. \n \n \n \nCENTRE \u0026 PHONE VOLUNTEERS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTraining:  \n \nOn-the job training is always given for Centre Volunteers in office procedures,  \nincluding data base entering, working with computers and the relevant programs \nand other Centre operations. This training is mostly carried out by the Co-ordinator \nwhilst also utilising the â€œbuddyâ€ system, where a more experienced volunteer passes \non their knowledge and assists the new volunteer. Other staff will train Volunteers \nnecessary for particular projects or events they are involved in at the time, giving \nthem a wider option of tasks to choose from. \n \nTelephone Listening Skills Training for 2012 is being planned for the 2012/13 year. \nWe will be re-offering this course to our members early in the year. \n \n  \n \nCentre Workload: \n \nDuring 2011-2012, almost 200 bereaved families made contact for the first time with \nThe Compassionate Friends Victoria, with many members being reinstated, after \nrealising they still get comfort and support, where nowhere else these needs are \nmet. Each new member received a package of information with a personal letter and \nwas then, permission given, entered onto our database. This is to enable them to \ncontinue receiving our magazines, anniversary cards and any other information on \nwhat is happening at the Centre. \n \nThe majority of these families made their first contact by phoning the Centre or  \nattending one of our Support Groups, email or our website. \n \n 25% were referred by professionals  \n 22% were referred by TCF members \n 20% were referred by family and friends \n 12% via Internet and media coverage \n \n \nI feel very privileged to be working in this organisation, especially with the friendship \nand support from my work colleagues, Board of Management and of course the \nwonderful Volunteers. \n \n \n \nThank You   \nSue Brown \nCo-ordinator Volunteers (Centre \u0026 After Hours Telephone) \n \n \n  GROUPS  \nCo-ordinator Volunteers  Groups \n \n \n \n \n \nThe 26 support and social support groups have continued to \nrun smoothly and confidently throughout the 2012 year, and as \nwe look forward to 2013, it is highly likely that a number of new \ngroups will be established in more isolated regional areas  \nduring that year. \n \n \nOn the latter note, we must thank Jon and Sue Stebbins for \nproviding group leader training in 2012. The training was  \nattended by nine members of The Compassionate Friends. \nSuch a level of attendance is positive for succession  \nleadership and ensuring the greatly beneficial peer support \nmodel will continue to be offered throughout Victoria. \n \n \nThank you also to Jon Stebbins for his recent work in  \ndetermining that the group leader training guidelines meet with \nthe nationally accredited Lifeline Standards, Guidelines and \nPractices for Bereavement Support Group Facilitation.  \nPreviously, the training guidelines met with NALAGâ€™s  \nguidelines for running support groups. However, it was  \nnecessary to conduct an analysis of the more recently  \nestablished Lifeline Guidelines, to ensure our training and  \nsupport principles remained up-to-date. Jonâ€™s analysis has \nclarified that this is indeed the case. \n \n \nJon and Sue Stebbins and I have also been visiting each of \nour support leaders, in person, during 2012. This is a slight \nchange with 2011, where we visited each group by attending \none of their meetings. These one-on-one visits have been  \nimmensely valuable in allowing the group leaders and support \nleaders to speak openly about their groups; what strengths \nthey cite, what challenges they face, and what additional  \nsupport they may need from TCF Centre. \n \n \nI have included below, some excerpts written by Jon, Sue or \nmyself, which indicate the commitment, care and ambition of \nour group leaders: \n \n \nâ€œThe leaders are very pleased with how their group is  \nprogressing \u0026 after spending time with them it was very  \nobvious the group leaderâ€™s confidence has increased greatly \nover the past year. With her support leader having completed \nGL training last year and feeling more confident in his support \nrole, they are now a skilled team \u0026 work well together.â€ \n \n \nâ€œThe group leader is very creative with activities for her group \nmembers. For example, she ran a scrapbook afternoon, with \neach member making a memory page about their child, and \nthese pages were then made into a book called a TCF  \nmemory album which is taken to each meeting.â€ \n \n \nâ€œTo extend the groupâ€™s reach into the community, the group \nleaders wanted to offer a support meeting during the evening \nand then, approximately two weeks later, hold a social meeting \nat a cafÃ© during the day.â€ \n \n \nIt should be noted, with the final example, that that support \ngroup has now expanded to offering both formal and social \nsupport meetings. Another group that has expanded in its \nreach is the siblings support group. With attendances now  \naveraging ten people per meeting, the siblings group has also \nrecently established itâ€™s own Facebook page, â€œSiblings  \nConnectionsâ€. The page has three administrators and offers a \nsupportive space for siblings to post messages, post links to \nmeaningful media and literature, and support each other in \ntheir grief. \n  \n \n2011 Group Leader Training  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Breeze (The Compassionate Friends Victoriaâ€™s support \ngroup co-ordinators newsletter) continues to be produced four \ntimes a year. It is a great pleasure to work on: the bulletin \ncombines articles relating to group co-ordination, articles \nsubmitted by our group co-ordinators themselves, reprints of \nnewspaper coverage of our group leaders, and updates of any \ngroup-related news. In this regard, the bulletin plays a number of \nroles: strengthening the community of group leaders; providing \nthem continuing education through informative article; and \nallowing them a platform in which to express and describe their \ngroup facilitation experiences to their â€œpeersâ€, and receive \nfeedback.  \n \n \nSome of the articles that have appeared in The Breeze have \nbeen: \n \n \nPermission to Grieve â€“ an article that describes and normalises \npost abortion grief.  \n \nCloud over Christmas â€“ an article on Hamilton group leader \nSue Beaton and how her sonâ€™s death has affected the \ncelebratory time of Christmas \n \nAn article on the annual suicide awareness walk in Geelong \nand Bendigo. \n \nNutrition through Grief â€“ an article which educates on how \ngood nutrition can help temper experiences of grief. \n \n \nOther avenues of support for the group co-ordinators, such as \nthe email discussion group, continue in educating and refreshing \ngroup co-ordinators in their multi-varied roles. A final note relates \nto our visits to group leaders; we have also visited TCF members \nin regional areas (Sale, Colac, Ararat) who have expressed an \ninterest in establishing groups in 2013. This has been a very \npositive exercise, providing those members with a personal link \nto the friendly and supportive world of The Compassionate \nFriends.  \n  \n \nAndrew McNess \nCo-ordinator of Volunteers Groups,  COMMUNITY EDUCATION/GRIEF AWARENESS/RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT \n \nFundraising \u0026 Partnership Projects \n \n The past 12 months have seen us grow beyond the introduction phase of  \nfundraising, with all the interesting learning curves associated, to implementation \nof strategic objectives developed by board of management. In the planning of \nfundraising activities the focus remains to diversify Compassionate Friendsâ€™  \nincome streams. We continue to proactively develop a range of income generation \nstrategies that support Compassionate Friendsâ€™ development and growth whilst \nensuring that we enhance our core service delivery currently being funded by the \nDepartment of Health. \n \nAchievements \nPartnerships \nWe continue to successfully develop a range of partnerships with people who  \nbelieve in Compassionate Friends worthy cause and who support us in this  \nfundraising domain in various ways. This year artist Jodie Cooper, a  \nbereaved sibling, has kindly created this piece below as a depiction of  \nCompassionate Friends as a collective. The heart shape balloon signifies our \nloved ones who have died, the hope Compassionate Friends brings and the  \nvaluable bonds that are formed between those left behind. Jodie holds periodic \nexhibitions of her artwork here at Compassionate Friendsâ€™ premises and donates \n20% of proceeds back to our organisation for which we gratefully appreciate \n \nThis year we also partnered with  \nKidsafe (not for profit organisation) in a \njoint fundraising event at Mornington \nRace Club. Sincere gratitude goes to \nour dedicated band of volunteers, \nboard members  for a fun filled day \nand in helping to spread the word of \nour good work amongst the attendees \nof â€˜2012 Family Charity Dayâ€™.  \n \n \nThis event could not have been  \npossible without the kind sponsorship \nof our valued business partners,  \nStafford Direct (Danny Bendel \n[pictured top left and Tribute  \nStationery (Linda Hay) pictured  \nbottom left. \n \n \n \nTo further enhance the fundraising \nwork commenced we have  \ndeveloped a Resource Action \nGroup and have met bi monthly \nthroughout the year. The purpose \nof this group is to provide  \nadditional expertise to support the \ngeneration of ideas and resources \nto achieve Compassionate Friends \nstated fundraising objective of  \ndiversifying income streams. \n \nCorporate/Business Partnerships  \nIn the short to midterm future resources will be invested to engage with our  \nCorporate and Business Supporters to explore the option of Sponsorship for our \nmember and community events including Compassionate Employer Recognition \nAwards, â€˜Walk to Rememberâ€™ Memorial Day and our â€œGrieve, Heal and Growâ€™ \nweekend gathering to be held next term. Sponsorships of these activities will be \nsought in the form of goods, services and/or funds.   \nFuture Direction \nCompassionate Friends is committed to continuously establishing relationships \nwith Trusts and Foundations, businesses and the community.  Activities to take \nplace in order to achieve this will continue to be submissions of grant applications, \nattendance at various corporate events, form new partnerships with businesses, \nhold Compassionate Friends fundraising events and implement a communication \nplan with donors, current and potential. \n \nCompassionate Friends have an excellent cause that really makes a difference to \npeopleâ€™s lives (in the midst of their grieving journeys) to be able to live well and I \nam confident this is transparent to our potential supporters. Every effort is made \non my behalf to see Compassionate Friends succeed in the implementation of our \nfundraising plan to attract and secure additional funding streams. \nJosie Costanzo \nGrief Awareness \u0026 Relationship Development Co-ordinator \n \n \nCommunity Education \u0026 Grief Awareness Project \n \nThis year has seen the successful continuation and growth of Grief Awareness Program. \nDuring our public speaking travels in this domain we commonly hear comments such as â€œI \nfelt so bad for them, I just didnâ€™t know what to say.â€ This indicates there is still a real need \nin the wider community to deliver grief education across all sectors. Death is such an \nunspoken topic that it generally tends to be avoided all together.  In order to demystify \ntypical misconceptions and better support individuals and families suffering the  \ndevastation experienced following the death of their loved one, an ongoing commitment to \nreach out to the general public will continue to break down these existing barriers. To \nachieve this objective this year, extensive marketing and information has continued  \nreaching a wider audience disseminating the message of support for the bereaved,  \nincluding their family, friends, employers, co workers and professionals.  \n \nCompassionate Friendsâ€™ general presentation concentrates on the services we offer to \nbereaved parents, siblings and grandparents, exposing our profile further, as well as  \nproviding practical support training. My dream is that every newly bereaved parent,  \ngrandparent and sibling will be aware Compassionate Friends is here to help and need \nnot face the isolation so many bereaved individuals experience in their grieving process. \nIn order to achieve this we will continue to dedicate our resources to extending our reach \ninto the broader community so that the information is widely disseminated and  passed \nonto families when a child dies. \n \nThis year we have continued to deliver â€˜How To Care What To Sayâ€™ grief education, \nawareness and training program designed to deliver theoretical and practical information \nto professionals and community participants to better equip them in supporting the  \nbereaved in their grieving. Both programs are delivered in power point presentation form \nwith content tailored for the needs of all audiences. \n \nOne of the outcomes of Compassionate Friendsâ€™ community education program is  \nmeasured by evaluations received by participants. Overwhelmingly, responses have  \nindicated that the program is delivered exceptionally well with key emphasis on the value \nof personal stories. The methodology of â€˜the lived experienceâ€™ is extremely effective in \nconveying the message of bereavement support to the wider community as a learning \nstrategy.  \n \nExamples of consistent feedback received across all sectors include; \n \nCommunity : Following a professional development seminar delivered by Compassionate \nFriends  , a Primary School teacher commented: \n \nâ€œThank you for coming and talking to our school community about Compassionate Friends \nand the worthwhile work you do. With our recent loss (student) your main message of \nâ€˜How to Care and What to Sayâ€™ has hopefully encouraged people to show their support \nand comfort to the grieving family. Keep up the good work!â€ \n \nSignificant achievements include: \npowerpoint presentation personalised for every volunteer presenter \nongoing training provided to public speaking group \n495 total participants at seminars to date \n 35 Total community education presentations to date \nextensive marketing of information and education program to all Victorian Schools \n \nRelationship Building: \nCommitment to engage the corporate sector continues, along with efforts to market our \ncommunity education program to Compassionate Employer Recognition Award recipients \nand other business contacts developed. This year we have maintained and built on  \nexisting relationships including Coronerâ€™s Court Melbourne, Aged Care sector, Politicians, \nAmbulance Victoria and Victoria Police via their online referral system. Ongoing Grief and \nBereavement Community Education programs will continue to be promoted and presented \nto a range of service clubs, hospitals, GPs, schools, community organisations and to  \nprofessionals in the wider community.   \n \nMuch gratitude goes to the Australian Centre of Grief and Bereavement for providing the \nmaterial to deliver â€˜How to Care, What to Sayâ€™ program. Thank you to Compassionate \nFriends board of management and band of incredibly passionate public speaking volun-\nteers for your continuing commitment and dedication in embracing the worth and need for \ncommunity education. \n  \nLooking Ahead: \nIt is with much excitement that I report Compassionate Friends is embarking on the  \ninevitable! â€“ entrance into the wonderful world of social media. Research clearly  \ndemonstrates that demographically a wider audience will search for support digitally in \ncomparison to face to face contact. Communication in this form is more likely to attract a \ngreater volume of bereaved families and hence an opportunity of further connection and \nengagement. Watch this space.............. \n \n \n \n \n \nLastly, and most importantly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all whom are \nassociated with this special organisation, from our board members, to our selflessly giving \nvolunteers, to our families who share their journeys with us to an incredibly amazing group \nof people I have the privilege of working with and calling My Compassionate Friends!  \nRAG Team Left to right: Lionel Leung, Daniel \nBendel, Sandy Baskin Josie Costanzo \nTheresa Yeo  Parents Magazine Report \n \nAvailable on \nEditor:   Deb Gates  \n \nTeam members:  Judy Dowling, Pat Burns, Helen Murphy \n         \u0026 Denise Steven \n \nLayout \u0026 Graphics: Peter Holloway \n \nProofreaders: Jenny Scott, Andrew McNess \n \nPrinters: Eastern Press \n \n \nEditor \n \nI have been impressed by the quality of the local content we have \nhad for the magazine.

The meetings allow us to choose articles \nfrom other newsletters, discuss themes and socialise.  As I often \ncannot make the meetings in person, the team does the work and \nsends the material on to me.   \n \nChanges \n \nThe last two magazines have had flyers printed in them rather \nthan included as separate items.

It is a \nstrong collaboration, and I greatly appreciate the ideas that \nLexi brings to the plate. \n \nFor instance, Lexi has provided us articles as diverse as â€œhow \nseasonal blues complicate griefâ€, â€œdigital media and paying \ntribute to your siblingâ€, and â€œhow good nutrition can help  \ntemper feelings of griefâ€. Lexi has a real awareness of how \ngrief affects us on many varied levels. I thank her for her  \nongoing involvement and commitment to the magazine. \n \nThe magazine is presented bi-monthly in glossy, colourful \nstyle; on that note, I must also thank our long-established  \nlayout and graphics person, Deb Gates, who continues to  \nproduce comforting cover designs and interior designs.  \n  \nThe magazine has also included articles relating to social  \nmedia: one article looked at videos covering siblingsâ€™ grief on \nYoutube; another announced a new Facebook group, called \nâ€œSiblings Connectionsâ€, which was created by members of \nTCF Victoriaâ€™s sibling support group. In the latter article,  \nreaders were invited to join this supportive and interactive \ngroup. \n \nAgain, it has been terrific to see articles being contributed by \nmembers of TCF Victoria. There have been Lexiâ€™s articles, but \nalso articles from four other members of TCF Victoria. One \narticle looked at the issue of â€œloneliness and griefâ€, while  \nanother explored both the personal and professional  \nexperience with grief. There was also an article that specified \nsome of the differences between sibling relationships and  \nparent-child relationships. \n  \nAll of us involved with the Brothers and Sisters magazine  \ncontinue to feel pride in the magazineâ€™s achievements, its \nrange of content and ongoing service to the sibling community. \n  \nAndrew McNess \nSibling Editor \n \n \n \nPARENTS MAGAZINE â€”SIBLINGS NEWSLETTER  UNITED JOURNEY UNVEILING â€”WALK TO REMEMBER â€”TCF GATHERING \n2011 â€˜United Journeyâ€™ Unveiling \nOn Friday 23\nrd\n of September at the centre â€œUnited Journeyâ€ donated and \npainted by Jodie Cooper was unveiled by  the Mayor of Boroondara, Cr \nNicholas Tragas, along with members,  guests and family.  Anne Wicking \nCEO, welcomed everyone to Compassionate Friends then Introduce Karen \nPhilippzig, bereaved mother of Bree spoke about what TCF has done to help \nher and what the painting will mean to all the TCF members.  \n \nThen the mayor Cr Nicholas Tragas took the floor, he was glad to know that \nhe talked about how inspiration of the painting and how it reflected hope for \nfamilies travelling the long grief journey. \nWalk to Remember was held on Sunday 1\nst\n of April 2012. Over 190 people \nregistered for the walk.  It is an opportunity for families to connect and to honour \ntheir child, brother, sister or grandchild, To support the sense of connection we \nhave the â€œWalk to Rememberâ€ T-Shirts  and everyone has a chance to bring a \nphoto on the day that we make into a badge \n.   \nThe  walk takes place at the picturesque Yarra River. On the bridge we held a \nsmall service, Sue Brown reflected on the walk, then John Bradley talked about \nTCF, (thank-you John), each family then placed a beautiful flower into the water \nin remembrance of their loved one, Sue read a poem and a copy of the poem \nwas given to each person. Following the formal part of the day there was the \nBBQ lunch. More time to talk to each other. This is what the day was about,  \nconnecting with other bereaved families. \n \nWe would like to thank the four funeral homes that sponsored \nour T-shirt so our participants could have them FREE. Tripodi \nFunerals, White Ladyâ€™s Funerals, Victoria Funerals and Syd \nPeek \u0026 Daughter Funerals,  \u0026 Tasman Meats Berwick \ndonated all the sausages and hamburgers.  \n \n \nI would like to thank Joe Galati and Bill Bardsley for cooking \nlunch for everyone, a job well done. I would like to thank all the \nstaff and volunteers that helped on the day. \n2012 Walk To Remember \nJodie then talked about how she came up with theme of the \npainting and that over a number of visits the centre she found  felt \nshe started to connect and  understand the journey of our families. \nShe drew inspiration from the 2010 Gathering, particularly the \nphoto of the release of the balloons representing the children, \nbrothers and sisters and grandchildren of Compassionate Friends \nbereaved families, along with the idea that a balloon is gentle and \nalways a childâ€™s favourite. \nThe butterflies are already a symbol used by â€˜Compassionate \nFriendsâ€™ and the colour palette were to compliment the stationary \nand office furniture. The painting is now hanging in its pride of \nplace in the front entry. Our heartfelt thanks to Jodie for translating \nthe message of â€œhopeâ€ into this artwork. \nLeft: Karen Philipzigg bereaved mother of Bree, Cr Nicholas Tragas, Mayor .

It was printed in the Herald Sun on Wednesday 22\nnd\n August. We \nsaw some new names added to this roll with a lot that honour their loved one \nyear after year. This is one of the ways we can remember our child or sibling. \n \n \nMagazine \n \nThe Magazine Committee now meets before each magazine. This group \nlooks at other magazines to see what they are doing and choose articles we \nmay like to add to our magazine. The feedback on the content of the  \nmagazine this year has been great.  With a lot more articles and photos  \ncoming from Victorian members, the stronger colours have also been  \nappreciated. The magazine has had a theme for each of the magazine.  \nRelationships, Step families, Anger and Guilt and for the Oct/Nov Grief Heal \nand Grow. \n \nWe are still receiving a lot of articles from our members. This makes putting \nthe magazine together much easier.  \n \n \nLibrary  \n \nWe are pleased to let you know that we have secured some funding  \nthroughout the year from the City of Geelong and the Order of St John of  \nJerusalem to set up a library for the Region.   \n \nIn addition to this Tobin Brothers has kindly donated all their books to The \nCompassionate Friends. \n \nThis year saw Bev our Liberian having to be at home more to support her \nhusband, who had not been well. While she was unable to work in the library, \nher assistant Bea was there to look after everything in her absence. \n \nBev has had a chance to look up and put together a wish list for some new \nbooks to add to our library. We have also had some book donated over the \nlast few months. Many thank to all who have donated.  \n \n \n \nOutreach Peer to Peer Suicide Support \n \nThe principle behind the Outreach Peer Support Program has continued into \nitâ€™s second year, providing much needed support to bereaved by suicide  \nfamilies.  We are commencing a full 3 month evaluation of the program with \nthe view of refining the model and hopefully extending the program to all  \nbereaved families. Thank you to Pilotlight, Cooper Investments and AndyInc \nfor providing funding for this program over the past 12 months. \n \n \nGrief Information and Resources \n \nWe have been given permission by the TCF  UK to utilise some of their grief \nresources.  In November this year  a group of bereaved parents and siblings \nwill commence reviewing the material for itâ€™s appropriateness to our families.  \nThis will add additional resources to our families. \n \nI would like to take this opportunity to thank my peers and the volunteers for \ntheir support and encouragement shown to me in the last twelve months. \n \nPlease also see Page 9, 10 \u0026 11 for further 2011/12 Events \u0026 Services  \nJenny Galati \nCo-ordinator Events \u0026 Services \nâ€œTime Outâ€ -  \nRetreat Accommodation Program \n \nBackground of ACORN Foundation  \n \nThe original idea for ACORN came in the early days of TCF when the \norganisation often had to move premises. TCF wanted its own safe \nenvironment for members and friends/ families to move forward beyond \ntheir initial grieving. It was then that the BUY A BRICK appeal was \nstarted, an ongoing opportunity to commemorate the memory of our \nchild/children.  \n \nIn February, 2011, the ACORN committee presented a document \noutlining a revised vision for these â€œBuy A Brickâ€ building fund \ncontributions. The committee recognised that buying a property in \nsuburban Melbourne would be beyond reach. A sub committee was \nthen formed (comprising three Acorn Foundation committee members \nand three Board of Management members) to explore other ways in \nwhich the outcome of \u0027time-out\u0027 could be achieved.  \n \nThe committee decided that a study should be undertaken to determine \nif there was a need for this type of service by the TCF membership. \nAndrew McNess, employed one day a week as Retreat Officer, was \nengaged to carry out this study in collaboration with the committee.  \n \nOn the basis of his report, the committee believed that a program should \nbe set up to provide needs-based, low-cost accommodation \nopportunities, sourced from different areas, for TCF members in need of \ntime away from their day to day lives, at those times when their grief is \noverwhelming.  \n \n \nThe â€œTime Outâ€ Retreat Accommodation Program \n \nA â€œTime Outâ€ retreat accommodation program is now been trialled. \nResponse from TCF membership who have taken up this program has \nbeen both extremely positive and greatly appreciative. A number of \nproperty owners and organisations, such as the Family Care Sisters and \nbed and breakfast owners, have become involved in this program to \noffer their properties at reduced rates to our membership. As a result, \nwe can respond to familiesâ€™ needs for â€œtime outâ€ at short notice, by \noffering them a range of potential retreat options. \nAs of September 16\nth\n 2012, 19 families have stayed at one of these \nretreat options, their stays ranging from 2 nights to 7 nights. Andrew \nMcNess has co-ordinated these bookings, as well as keeping the \norganisations and property owners up-to-date with the progress and \nbeneficial results of this program. \nWhile a range of retreat options have been sourced, further retreat \noptions will be investigated, particularly in regional areas.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n \nThis financial report is a special purpose financial report prepared in order to satisfy the financial reporting requirements of the Associationâ€™s \nIncorporation Act (Vic) 1981. The Board has determined that the Association is not a reporting entity. \n \nThe financial report has been prepared on an accruals basis and is based on historic costs and does not take into account changing money \nvalues or, except where specifically stated, current valuations of non current assets. \n \nThe following specific accounting policies, which are consistent with the previous period unless otherwise stated, have been adopted in the \npreparation of this financial report. \n \n   Principal Activities \na  The principal activity of the Compassionate Friends â€“ Victoria Inc is to deliver much needed services to bereaved parents siblings \nand grandparents across Victoria. \n  \nb.          Equipment, Furniture \u0026 Motor Vehicles \n  Equipment, Furniture \u0026 Motor Vehicles are included in the accounts at cost, less accumulated depreciation, as specified. All fixed \nassets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives commencing from the time the asset is held ready for use. Any gain or loss \non disposal of fixed assets is determined as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset at the time of disposal and the \nproceeds of disposal, and is included in determining the financial results of the entity in the year of disposal. \n \nC. Taxation \n  The Association is a tax exempt body under the Income Tax Act 1997 and therefore does not account for income tax. \n \nd. Leave Liabilities \n  Leave liabilities are stated at nominal values with no allowance for on cost or indexation to net present value as the difference would \nnot be material. A liability for sick leave has been recognised based on entitlements and rights to balance date. \n \ne. Impairment Assets \n  At the end of each reporting period, the entity reviews the carrying values of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether \nthere is any indication that those assets have been impaired. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being \nthe higher of the assetâ€™s fair value less costs to sell and value in use, is compared to the assetâ€™s carrying value. Any excess of the \nassetâ€™s carrying value over its recoverable amount is exposed to the income statement. \n \nf. Cash and Cash Equivalents \n  Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments \nwith original maturities of less than twelve months. \n  FINANCIAL 2011-2012 \n \n \nTHE COMPASSIONATE FRIENDS â€“ VICTORIA INC \n \nABN: 51 374 578 204 \n \nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30\nth\n JUNE 2012 \n \nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n \n \ng. Revenue and Other Income  \n Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable after taking into account any trade \ndiscounts and volume rebates allowed. For this purpose, deferred consideration is not discounted to present values \nwhen recognising revenue. \n \n Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest rate method, which for floating rate financial assets is the \nrate inherent in the instrument. \n  \n Grant and donation income is recognised when the entity obtains control over the funds, which is generally at the time \nof receipt. \n \n All revenue is stated net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST). \n \nh. Goods and Services Tax (GST) \n Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred \nis not recoverable from the Tax Office. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition \nof the asset or as part of an item of the expense.  \n \n Receivables and payables in the assets and liabilities statement are shown inclusive of GST. \n \ni. Critical Accounting Estimates \n The Committee evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial statements based on historical \nknowledge and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and \nare based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Association. \n \n Key Estimates \n  \n(a) The Association assesses impairment at the end of each reporting period by evaluating conditions and events spe-\ncific to the Association that may be indicative of impairment triggers. \n \n(b) Unexpended grants and income is calculated by subtracting actual expenditure including an allowance for on costs \nfrom any specific project grants received. \n  FINANCIAL 2011-2012 \n \n \n \nTHE COMPASSIONATE FRIENDS â€“ VICTORIA INC \n \nABN: 51 374 578 204 \n \nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30\nth\n JUNE 2012 \n \n \n 2012 2011 \n                                                                                             $             $ \n2.

Once the trailer is stopped, one person can easily extend the auger into position under the trailer. The hopper can be extended or retracted as well as swung side to side to empty from 2 or 3 trailer hoppers. Once the trailer is empty the auger is retracted to allow freedom of movement of the trailer. The controls are mounted by the hopper. There is no need for 2 people, no need to drive and swing at the same time, and it is very difficult to drive over the hopper.\nFor further information, please contact us or view our demonstration video below.\nÂ Â Â \nÂ Â Â Â \nÂ \nÂ Â Â \nÂ \nÂ Â Â Â \nÂ \nÂ Â Â \nÂ Â Â \nPrivacy Statement\nCopyright 2012 Burando Hill\nDesigned by Leapfrog Business Solutions .\n",

After dinner the Conference will begin by introducing our featured speaker, Fr Gerald Oâ€™Collins sj.\nFriday and Saturday will emphasize the spirit of prayer and reflection to which we have become accustomed as a community of consolation, united in prayer and companionship. There will be a flow of input from various speakers, reflection and sharing throughout the day. Each day will begin with prayer at 8.30 am.\nThe Conference Dinner on Saturday night with a guest speaker will be a highlight. The AGM will precede the closing Eucharist and lunch on Sunday.\nNEW AECSD AND CIS REPRESENTATIVESÂ \nThe Australian Ecumenical Council for Spiritu-al Direction was set up to monitor the stand-ards of spiritual direction training programs in Australia.\nIt is essential that Companions, as the key organization for accrediting those who wish to direct in the Ignatian tradition, has a repre-sentative on this central coordinating body. Mary Murphy, a long standing committee member of Companions has agreed to repre-sent us on the AECSD.\nIn a second significant initiative the Directors of the Centres for Ignatian Spirituality throughout Australia have requested that Companions be represented on their Com-mittee. Again this task will require a consid-erable commitment of time.\nThe CIS centres lie at the heart of Ignatian spirituality education and formation in Aus-tralia and have been generous sponsors and encouragers of Companions over the years so this association will prove invaluab\nTricia Giles has generously offered her ser-vices in this capacity. The Committee thanks both Mary and Tricia for undertak-ing these important tasks on the be\nhalf of the Committee and our members.\nAECSD Conference\nThe AECD Conference for 2012 â€˜Sharing the Giftsâ€™ will be held from Friday 21st Sep-tember until Sunday the 23rd.\nThe keynote speaker is Monty Williams sj from Loyola House Retreat and Training Centre in Guelph, Canada. Monty also teaches at Regis College, University of To-ronto. He is well know as a writer on Igna-tian spirituality.\nOne of his best known books is â€˜Finding God in the Darkâ€”Taking the Spiritual Exercises to the Moviesâ€™ in which he uses film as a meditative tool to bring the Exercises to a contemporary audience. His recent book â€˜Spiritual Intimacyâ€™ provides an in-depth unpacking of the dynamics of the Exercises.\nFor details see the AECD website www.spiritualdirection.org.au\nÂ \nAttention !

Kerry says the highlights have been the presentations on aspects of the diaries and Spiritual Exercises from a Spanish perspective.\nThe participants have travelled to the green valleys of Loyola and walked the 23 km from Monserrat to Manresa through bush and fields with poppies, and rocky paths and roads. On the way they have seen the black Madonna. Most significant of all for Kerry however have been the many conversations with the other participants, from 20 different countries all â€˜steeped in Ignatian Spiritualityâ€™ and sharing this wonderful experience together.\nKerry, as an artist is using her painting to capture her experiences.

That wealth will in most cases comprise assets held personally and jointly, superannuation, insurance policies, by private trusts, companies and partnerships. How this wealth is held will also affect social security entitlements and the taxation of that wealth.\nEstate planning comprises planning how your wealth is to be owned, managed and preserved during your lifetime and how you want it distributed when you die.\nYou can increase the size of your estate by ensuring that it is passed onto your beneficiaries in the most financially efficient and tax effective way. This requires an understanding of complex rules, establishing and maintaining appropriate legal, family and investment structures and anticipating changes requiring corrective action.\nSome people have more complicated lives than others in that they are a part of blended families or have beneficiaries with disabilities or special needs. They may also have children who are encountering marriage difficulties and do not wish to see their family wealth end up in the hands of an outsider.\nSome people\u0027s wealth may also be at risk due to their profession or business activities in the event that they are not properly insured.\nWith a myriad of complex rules and regulations involving Bankruptcy, Taxation, Superannuation, Social Security and Succession and Family Law to consider, having anyone but an Accredited Specialist * assisting you with your planning can be disastrous. Why take the gamble? We can assist you and your financial planner and accountant with a range of issues in arriving at the perfect plan for you.

This resource offers insights into nine key factors that help grow successful \ncommunity gardens (the 9Ps) and provides tips to assist you in establishing or maintaining a vibrant and viable \ncommunity garden in your local area.  \nThe resource draws on experience gained through coordinating the Growing Communities WA project that \nsupported the development of community gardens in Western Australia from 2008 to 2010 and is informed by \naction research carried out for the project with Lockridge Community Garden and West Leederville Community \nGarden. It is designed specifically for community self-managed gardens, but will also be relevant to agency-\nmanaged and Council-managed gardens. Whilst the resource draws on the experience of community gardens in \nWA, the information and tips provided will be relevant for community gardens anywhere. \nTHE 9PS \n1. Plants â€“ build on the special qualities of gardens  \n2. People â€“ you canâ€™t do it alone \n3. Planning (and chaos!) â€“ develop a shared vision \n4. Process â€“ how you get there is important \n5. Partnerships â€“ many and diverse \n6. Place â€“ make a great community place  \n7. Physical maintenance â€“ gardens need constant love \n8. Patience â€“ it wonâ€™t happen overnight \n9. Pleasure â€“ it needs to be fun! \n1. PLANTS â€“ BUILD ON THE SPECIAL QUALITIES OF GARDENS \nOf course you donâ€™t need reminding that plants are a crucial element in any community garden. However it is \nuseful to remember that it is the special qualities of gardening and plants that make community gardens \ndifferent from other community facilities and also extends the range of benefits they can generate for \ncommunities. Plants are complex, natural, living organisms that can be cultivated and sometimes consumed for \nfood. As a result of these qualities, community gardens:  \n Are natural, living environments. Community gardens are â€˜life-fullâ€™ places where the very structures and \nelements of the space are living and growing (just as we are). They help to connect people with nature, the \nseasons and the cycles of life. This can enhance mental health and well-being, as well as encouraging a \ncommitment to caring for the natural environment. Through use of composting and worm farming systems, \ngardens also offer communities natural waste management solutions. \n \n Are beautiful, sensory environments. Community gardens are full of wonderful sights (colours, textures, \npeople, artwork), sounds (bees buzzing, birds singing, children laughing), tastes (food picked fresh from the \ngarden), smells (aromatic herbs, sweet compost, food cooking) and tactile experiences (warm sun on your \nback, wriggling worms, hands in the soil). The stimulation of the senses in a garden helps bring a sense of \npeace and makes them therapeutic environments. \n \n Are interesting and informative environments. Plants and ecosystems are complex; understanding them \ncan be a lifeâ€™s work. Community gardens offer almost never-ending opportunities for learning across a wide \nrange of areas and for putting knowledge and skills into practice. This makes them great â€˜outdoor classroomâ€™ \nvenues for informal learning, school-based learning, formal education and training courses and lifelong \nlearning.    \n \nPage5 \n Connect people with food and food cultures. Access to good food is one of the fundamental building blocks \nof human life. Getting involved in community gardens helps people to better understand where food comes \nfrom, encourages healthy food choices and can enhance nutritional health. There is much vibrant and rich \ncultural activity bound up with the growing, harvesting and enjoyment of food. Community gardens also \nconnect people with their own and other peopleâ€™s food cultures and therefore enhance the cultural vitality \nof communities. \n \n Encourage people to be physically active. Gardening is a physical activity and hence involvement in \ncommunity gardens can bring physical health benefits. Depending on abilities, people can choose between \nlight physical exercise and more strenuous activities in the garden. \n \n Offer people a place to â€˜put down rootsâ€™. For migrants and refugees (or even people moving to a new \nsuburb, town or city), the act of literally â€˜putting down rootsâ€™ by planting in a community garden can help \nthem to connect with their new home.  \n \n Are inclusive places. The range of skill levels catered for and activities on offer, together with the â€˜hands onâ€™ \nnature of gardening and the universal language of food, mean that community gardens provide fabulous \nopportunities for cross-cultural connections and for social participation by people who find it difficult to \naccess traditional recreation and leisure options in the community. Community gardens are also one of the \nfew types of community facilities where youâ€™ll commonly see people of all ages coming together and \nintergenerational exchange taking place. \nThese are the key strengths and offerings of community gardens â€“ make the most of them! Staying focused on \nbuilding on the special qualities of plants and gardens will help your community garden to succeed.  \n2. PEOPLE â€“ YOU CANâ€™T DO IT ALONE \nJust as you canâ€™t have a community garden without a garden, itâ€™s equally true that you canâ€™t have a community \ngarden without a community. People are the other critical element. If you can â€˜get the people stuff rightâ€™, you \nare a long way towards having a successful community garden. \nHOW MANY PEOPLE DOES IT TAKE TO GROW A COMMUNITY GARDEN? \nThe number of people you will need to start and maintain a community garden in your local area will depend to \nsome degree on the size and scale of your community gardening initiative. As a general rule, the people involved \nin community gardens tend to fall into the following three categories:  \n \nSupporters / \npartners\nMembers\nCore group  \n \nPage6 \nMost gardens tend to have a core organising group of around 6 to 20 people who spearhead the development \nand management of the garden. For some gardens, the core group organise themselves in an informal manner, \nwhilst others adopt formal committee roles. Ideally, there will be a good mix of skills and interests in the core \ngroup for your garden and enough people to share the organisational workload so that it remains fun!  \nIn addition to a core group, community gardens will generally have a broader membership base of people who \ncontribute to and use the garden and share the physical workload. They might â€˜leaseâ€™ a plot (in an allotment-\nstyle garden), regularly tend communal garden beds or take on other garden maintenance roles. Some gardens \nhave structured membership categories with fees, whilst membership is informal in other gardens. To be viable \nin the long-term, your garden will need a membership base of sufficient size to keep on top of the ongoing \nmaintenance tasks associated with your garden (this will vary depending on the size and scale of your garden).  \nSupporters and partners make up the third group of people involved in community gardens. This is the wide \nnetwork of people who have connections with gardens and contribute to their success in some way, for example \nLocal Council staff who secure support for gardens in their local area, community members who attend events at \ngardens, businesses who sponsor gardens, staff from disability agencies who bring clients to use gardens, school \nteachers who hold lessons in gardens and so on. Having a broad supporter base and a variety of partnerships will \nenhance the vibrancy and long-term viability of your garden. See the Partnerships section for more information. \nENGAGING PEOPLE \nThe question of how to engage people in your community garden is a critical one in the establishment phase of \nthe garden and remains important as you continue along your community garden journey. People from all walks \nof life, backgrounds, ages and interests get involved in community gardens; there is no stereotyped â€˜community \ngardenerâ€™. Whilst gardening is a focus, community gardens are generally multi-purpose community hubs for a \nrange of activities including education and training, playgroups, arts and creative activities, preparing and \nsharing food, community events and celebrations, and social enterprise. These days it is common to find people \nwho are interested in community gardening: \n Residing in the streets surrounding the garden   \n Involved in the local residentsâ€™ association  \n Using the local community, neighbourhood or learning centre \n In gardening clubs, organic growersâ€™ associations and slow food groups \n In local environmental groups  \n In local service clubs \n Attending local playgroups  \n Attending local churches \n Working for local schools and training providers \n Working for the Local Council or serving as a Local Councillor \n Working for organisations based locally that offer services for people with mental health issues or \ndisabilities \nYour efforts to attract new people to your garden will be most effective if you use a variety of engagement \nstrategies to help you tap into the interest and enthusiasm of these different groups of people. For example, \nWest Leederville Community Garden has found that having Earth Carer training courses (community waste \neducation programs) delivered at the garden is an effective way of engaging new people. They also host annual \ngarden open days and ran a project to engage local young people by inviting them to spray-paint artwork to \nadorn the garden shed. Busselton Community Garden runs a â€˜Mums, Bubs and Grubsâ€™ playgroup at the garden \nthat brings in young families and has attracted other new people by hosting a wide range of community \nworkshops and activities such as organic vegetable gardening, sour dough bread making, harvest feasts, solstice \ncelebrations and car boot sales.    \n \nPage7 \n \nWest Leederville Community Garden shed decorated with artwork created by local young people \nOnce youâ€™ve attracted interest and attention to your community garden, the next step to involving more people \nis providing specific opportunities to â€˜plug-inâ€™ to the garden. Opportunities could include: becoming a member; \nâ€˜leasingâ€™ a plot; volunteering to maintain communal garden areas; participating in busy bees; joining the \norganising committee; joining the garden mailing list; making a donation; or providing sponsorship. It is \nimportant to publicise and promote the various ways that people can get involved in your garden, to help \nconvert peopleâ€™s interest in the garden into active involvement. You could include this information on garden \nsignage, your website, in flyers and leaflets handed out at the garden or distributed locally, through email \nnewsletters or at a membership stall set up during garden events and open days. \nINDUCTING NEW MEMBERS OR VOLUNTEERS INTO THE GARDEN \nTaking new people through an induction process when they join your community garden will contribute to \nsuccessful garden functioning and long-term viability. An effective induction process will help to: \n Make people feel welcome  \n Ensure people are aware of their rights and responsibilities (in particular in relation to maintaining plots and \ncommunal areas) \n Make people aware of any facilities available at the garden \n Ensure people understand how the garden is run, how they can have input to decision making and what \nsteps will be taken to resolve any conflict in the garden \n Make people aware of opportunities for social interaction in the garden \n Enhance safety and security at the garden \nWest Leederville Community Garden has recently updated their process for inducting new people into the \ngarden, to make it more formal and comprehensive. The experience of the garden is that by making the \ninduction process a bit more â€˜officialâ€™, new members are more likely to take it seriously and to fulfill their \nresponsibilities. The gardenâ€™s induction program now includes the provision of a Garden Participation Pack \n(including information on roles and responsibilities, the history of the garden and gardening tips), a garden talk \nand tour (delivered using a checklist of all the points that need to be covered), signing of a garden agreement \nand completion of an induction survey (to let the garden know how well people have understood key \ninformation and give new members the opportunity to provide feedback). Samples of these induction tools are \navailable to download from the Community Gardens WA website (www.communitygardenswa.org.au). \n    \n \nPage8 \n3. PLANNING (AND CHAOS!) â€“ DEVELOP A SHARED VISION \nCommunity gardens come in all shapes and sizes. There is no â€˜one size fits allâ€™ community garden model or \ntemplate that can be transplanted into communities and therefore a range of planning decisions need to be \nmade when starting a new garden or further developing an existing garden. Some key decisions relate to the: \n Size of the garden (small vegetable patch, large scale community facility or something in between)  \n Style of the garden (allotment, communal or both) \n Design elements in the garden (e.g. composting systems, pizza oven, poultry, disability access features)  \n Management structure of the garden (e.g. informal structure, incorporated association) \n Garden practices (organic or not organic) \n Types of plants \nComing together and spending time identifying the overall aims and goals of your particular garden will give your \ngroup a clear framework within which to make these and other planning decisions. For example, if your vision is \nfor the garden to be a place thatâ€™s welcoming and inspiring for children, then youâ€™ll want to ensure there are \ndesign features that help to achieve this (perhaps a sandpit, climbing frame, frog pond or having chooks in the \ngarden). If education is an important part of your vision then youâ€™ll want to consider possible outdoor classroom \nareas. And so on.  \nItâ€™s also useful to remember that people get involved in community gardens for different reasons and come with \ndifferent experiences of and ideas about community gardens. Creating a shared vision is about getting people on \nthe same page and working towards the same goal. Undertaking a planning and visioning process for your \ngarden will give people the opportunity to discuss and reach agreement about its purpose and therefore \nminimise the chance of conflict emerging about how the garden should be developed.  \nVISIONING PROCESSES \nThere are a variety of ways you could engage people in creating a shared vision for your community garden. \nDifferent approaches will work better for some groups than others. You would know from your own experience \nwhether you prefer to fill in a questionnaire, take part in a small group discussion, attend a large public meeting \nor perhaps participate in a creative arts-based activity. All of these approaches can be useful for generating a \nvision for your garden; it is a good idea to offer a few different ways for people to have input to your vision in \norder to ensure the process is inclusive of the whole garden community.    \nIf you would like some support in conducting a visioning process for your community garden, it is likely that \nthere will be people in your local community who have expertise in this area and would be willing to assist (for \nexample Local Council community development staff or people working in a local community, neighbourhood or \nlearning centre). Some gardens find it useful to secure funds to buy-in a skilled, external facilitator to assist with \nvisioning processes. \nHere are some visioning questions that may be helpful in identifying the overall aims and goals of your garden: \n What activities do you envisage happening in the community garden?  \n Who will use the garden and what will they use it for? \n What community needs could the community garden help to meet? \n What issues in your community could the community garden help to address?  \n What initiatives or activities that are already happening (or are planned) in your community could \ncomplement the community garden? \n What organisations, groups or businesses in your area might benefit from partnering with the community \ngarden? \n    \n \nPage9 \nALLOWING CHAOS AND RENEWING YOUR VISION \nDeveloping a vision and plan for your garden doesnâ€™t mean that things canâ€™t change and evolve along the way. A \nhealthy dose of chaos is important in any living system and this is certainly true in the development of \ncommunity gardens. At Busselton Community Garden for example, an unexpected donation of childrenâ€™s play \nequipment changed the initial garden design. The play structure ended up being installed in the centre of the \ngarden, providing a wonderful focal point that has really put the involvement of children at the â€˜heartâ€™ of the \ngarden. \nA good approach is to develop a vision for your garden in the early stages \nand then build-in regular (perhaps yearly) opportunities for renewing it. \nWest Leederville Community Garden recently benefitted from renewing \ntheir vision after being open for two and a half years. The process provided \na good opportunity to celebrate the achievements of the garden in that \ntime. It also helped to reinvigorate long-term members as well as giving \nnew people a chance to feel included, have an increased sense of \nâ€˜ownershipâ€™ of the garden, offer their skills and put their hand up for tasks. \nRenewing your gardenâ€™s vision over time will help it to stay in touch with \nthe changing needs of the people involved in the garden and your local \ncommunity. \nPlay equipment at Busselton Community Garden \n \n4. PROCESS â€“ HOW YOU GET THERE IS IMPORTANT \nCommunity gardens arenâ€™t like regular public gardens or parks. Theyâ€™re not simply places to grow food and \nplants; theyâ€™re places that grow community. At their heart, community gardens are community development \ninitiatives that strengthen and build the resilience of local communities through increasing community \nconnections and networks of support, developing the skills and knowledge of local people, identifying and \nbuilding on local assets, and encouraging community members to work cooperatively to solve problems and \nmeet their own needs.  \nIn order for your garden to ultimately be a place that builds community, itâ€™s important that the process of \ndeveloping the garden â€“ or â€˜how you get thereâ€™ â€“ is a community-building experience. The following process \nprinciples will help keep your garden on track: \n Ensure your garden reflects and expresses local needs, interests and culture. If your garden is to be well-\nused and viable in the long-term, it needs to reflect and express the needs, interests and culture of the \npeople involved in the garden and the community that surrounds it. \n \n Invite and welcome involvement from a wide range of people in the community around your garden. The \ndevelopment of your garden will be enriched and strengthened through engaging as wide and diverse a \nrange of community members as possible. Like a healthy eco-system, diversity is strength in a community \ngarden. Some people will be interested in being involved in planning and decision-making, whilst others will \nonly want to get involved once the garden is up and running and they can tend their own plot. Be prepared \nfor and invite these different degrees of involvement. Look for opportunities to involve people at every \nstage of start-up, design, construction and ongoing management of the garden.  \n \n    \n \nPage10 \n Build connections. Community gardens can serve as hubs for people to meet, make friends and develop \nnetworks of support and exchange. These connections enhance personal and community resilience. Find \nways to make and build connections between the various people, groups and organisations involved in your \ngarden.  \n \n Value local skills, knowledge and resources. Look for skills, knowledge and resources within your garden \ngroup and local community before calling in outside â€˜expertsâ€™ to do things on your behalf. This will \ncontribute to building pride, self-reliance and self-sufficiency in your garden and consequently your local \ncommunity. Conducting a simple skills audit of the people involved with your garden can help to uncover \nthe skills, knowledge and resources of your group. One way to do this is by including some basic questions \non these topics in your gardenâ€™s membership form.  \n \n Build local capacity. When you do bring in outside expertise to assist with developing and maintaining your \ngarden, look for ways to build the knowledge and skills of people involved in the garden at the same time. \nFor instance, a straw bale building workshop was held at Carss Park community garden in Sydney where \nmembers learnt skills under the guidance of a qualified instructor whilst assisting with the construction of a \nstraw bale building onsite.   \n \n \n \nStraw bale building being constructed at Carss Park Community Garden in Sydney \n \n5. PARTNERSHIPS â€“ MANY AND DIVERSE \nYour garden will be strengthened through having partnerships with a diverse range of organisations and groups. \nPartnerships will help to bring additional people and resources to your garden and expand your supporter base. \nThe wide appeal of community gardens means a growing number of governments, community organisations, \nbusinesses and community groups are actively seeking out opportunities to partner with gardens. There has \nreally been no better time for your garden to secure productive partnerships to help it survive and thrive. \nPOTENTIAL PARTNERS \nThe visioning questions listed in the Planning section provide a useful starting point for identifying potential \npartners and avenues of support for your community garden. The following organisations and groups are some \nof the key potential partners for community gardens. \n    \n \nPage11 \nLOCAL COUNCILS \nCommunity gardens can help Local Councils to achieve their strategic aims and Councils can play a key role in \nensuring community gardens are viable, so there is a natural fit between them. Community gardens benefit from \ndeveloping strong, positive relationships with both Local Councillors and relevant Council staff. There are many \ndifferent ways that Local Councils can support community gardens, including through the provision of: land; \nfunding; insurance cover; Council worker time; advertising and promotion; and supplies of water, electricity and \nmulch. Gardens can relate to a number of areas within Local Councils, however staff that are actively involved in \nsupporting community gardens most commonly work in the Community Development, Sustainability, \nEnvironment or Parks and Gardens areas of Councils.  \nREGIONAL COUNCILS \nRegional Councils exist within the Perth metropolitan area and in regional areas of WA. They work on behalf of \nmember Local Councils to provide coordinated waste management and other services and activities that benefit \nfrom regional collaboration (for example environmental management, regional and urban development and risk \nmanagement). Many Regional Councils deliver waste education to the community, to encourage people to \nâ€˜reduce, reuse and recycleâ€™. The use of composting and worm farming systems in community gardens means \nthey can provide interesting and informative venues for delivering community waste education; hence the \npotential value of partnering with gardens. Waste Education Officers at Regional Councils are good contacts for \ncommunity gardens.  \nCOMMUNITY, NEIGHBOURHOOD AND LEARNING CENTRES \nCommunity, neighbourhood and learning centres are friendly, comfortable places which offer a wide range of \ncourses to the community at minimal costs, including courses for adults, workshops, discussion groups, \nexhibitions, displays, management training and social events. Centres are continually looking for new, attractive \nand relevant adult learning activities and opportunities to offer to their members. Community gardens can offer \ncentres high quality and accessible outdoor learning environments either onsite or at a neighbouring location. \nThey can enhance the relevance, appeal and accessibility of centres by providing opportunities for:  \n Inclusive activities, such as activities suitable for frail aged and people with disabilities, intergenerational \nand cross-cultural activities and activities that appeal to male members of the community  \n \n â€˜Hands-onâ€™ informal learning through regular volunteering in the garden \n \n Formal learning opportunities through the wide range of community courses and programs that can be \ndelivered in community garden settings, such as organic vegetable gardening, waterwise gardening, \ncomposting and worm farming, art in the garden and healthy, seasonal cooking \n \n The creation of beautiful outdoor spaces to be enjoyed by the whole centre community that also enhance \nthe appeal of the centre as a venue for hire \n \nOTHER ORGANISATIONS AND GROUPS \n \n State and federal government agencies (particularly in the areas of housing, health, mental health, disability, \ntraining and employment) \n Community service organisations \n Property developers \n Education providers  \n Schools \n Community groups \n Church groups \n Service clubs (e.g. Rotary)  \n   \n \nPage12 \nCONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS \nItâ€™s important to remember that it takes a fair amount of time and a strong commitment to make partnerships \nwork. Before your garden rushes into the first partnership opportunity that comes along, make sure you check \nthat your garden committee and/or membership are willing and able to invest the necessary time and energy \ninto making the partnership work and that the following conditions\n1\n for an effective partnership are in place: \n Partners have a shared interest or concern \n The partnership has a clear purpose; partners have a common understanding of what the partnership is \nabout \n Partners are interested in and able to work together; there is a good relationship between one or more key \npeople   \n Partners believe the partnership brings benefit and real value to their existing activities  \n There is recognition and acknowledgement of any differences in the contexts that the partners work within \n(i.e. if partners come from the government or private sectors there is likely to be differences between them \nand gardens in terms of areas of skills and knowledge, resources, priorities, timelines and so on) \n There are agreed and effective communication processes put in place for the partnership  \n There is regular feedback between partners about the progress, glitches, achievements and next steps for \nthe partnership \nItâ€™s a good idea to have some agreed processes in place for how your garden will weigh up and makes decisions \nabout potential partnership opportunities. You might find it helpful to come up with your own checklist for \nassessing opportunities, e.g. must help achieve the goals of the garden; must bring in income or at least not \nleave the garden â€˜out of pocketâ€™; must engage groups that the garden wants to engage and so on. Be prepared \nto say no to potential partnerships that wonâ€™t work well or wonâ€™t deliver sufficient benefits to your garden and \nyour community. For more information on successful partnerships see the Growing Education: Community \ngardens building effective partnerships with education providers and Funding Your Community Garden resources \nthat are available to download from the Community Gardens WA website (www.communitygardenswa.org.au).  \n6. PLACE â€“ MAKE A GREAT COMMUNITY PLACE \nCommunity gardens that are well-used and much-loved are great community places. Project for Public Spaces \n(world leaders in the field of place making) have studied successful public places around the world and identified \nfour qualities\n2\n that they share. Enhancing these four qualities in your community garden will help it to thrive:  \n People are engaged in activities. Itâ€™s a simple idea: the more things there are to do in your garden, the more \npeople will use the garden. A good place to start is to identify ten things you could do in your garden and \nplan your design to support these (for example possible activities could include gardening, resting in a \npeaceful sitting spot, preparing and sharing food, interacting with animals, playing chess, attending a \nworkshop or creating garden artwork). Having a greater range of potential uses on offer in your garden \n(both active and passive) means that family or intergenerational groups are more likely to use the garden \ntogether.  \n \n                                                                 \n1\n This list of conditions has been compiled from Frank and Smith (2006), VicHealth (n.d.) and Mitchell and Goodall (2010). \n2\n Project for Public Spaces (n.d.).    \n \nPage13 \n The space is accessible. Your garden will be more successful if it is easy to see into and easy to get to. Look \nfor ways to increase visibility into the garden (people are more likely to enter a space if they can see good \nthings are happening in it), to enhance the accessibility of the garden for people with disabilities, to link the \ngarden with walking routes and public transport options and to provide sufficient space for parking bikes \nand cars.  \n \n The space is comfortable and has a good image. How does your community garden look from the street? \nDoes it make a good first impression? Attractive gardens will be more appealing. This doesnâ€™t mean gardens \nneed to be neat and ordered places; whatâ€™s important is that it is clear people care for the space and there \nare beautiful and interesting elements to entice people in. Ensuring your garden is a comfortable place to \nspend time is another key to success (this includes the availability of places to sit, perceptions of safety, \ncleanliness, protection from the weather and access to amenities like toilets and drinking water).  \n \n It is a sociable space, where people meet each other and take people when they come to visit. You can \nencourage a welcoming and convivial atmosphere in your garden by taking the time to greet and speak to \npeople who come to the garden, learning the names of fellow gardeners, creating spaces for people to \ngather and spend time together (e.g. tables and chairs under shelter), organising social activities for garden \nmembers and nurturing a culture where simply â€˜hanging outâ€™ in the garden is smiled upon. \n \nSunday mornings at Lockridge Community Garden - making a great community place \nFor almost a year now, Lockridge Community Garden has been attracting a good crowd of people to the garden \nfor monthly, free gardening workings on Sunday mornings. However itâ€™s not the workshops alone that account \nfor this success. As one gardener recently remarked, â€œit feels like the garden has become a placeâ€. There are a \nrange of activities on offer including attending the workshop, buying a freshly cooked pizza straight from the \ngardenâ€™s pizza oven, checking out the â€˜Bring and Buyâ€™ swap meet happening at the senior citizensâ€™ centre next \ndoor, chatting and hanging out with friends and neighbours and, (for kids) enjoying a free mini-train ride run by \nthe local Rotary Club. The garden has plenty of different seating options and shade structures are set up during \nthe workshops to keep people comfortable. There is no fence around the Lockridge Community Garden so itâ€™s \neasy for people walking past to see all the action, wander in and stay awhile. The welcoming and casual \natmosphere of the Sunday mornings mean people are able to move freely and easily between different activities \nand to simple â€˜hang outâ€™. A great example of how effective place making can enhance a community garden!   \n \nPage14 \n              \n \nGardening workshops at Lockridge garden \n \nEating and hanging out at Lockridge garden \n \n7. PHYSICAL MAINTENANCE â€“ GARDENS NEED CONSTANT LOVE \nWhilst community gardens have a lot in common with other community facilities, one significant way they differ \nis the amount of regular physical maintenance required to keep them functioning. Gardens are living structures \nthat need constant care and nourishment to survive and thrive. Many vegetable plants are only expected to live \nfor one season. Compost needs to be turned, fruit trees pruned and seeds planted. The great benefit of the living \nnature of community gardens is that they can constantly adapt and evolve in response to the changing needs \nand interests of the people involved; the challenge of these types of community facilities is staying on top of the \nphysical maintenance tasks required to keep things working and looking good. \nDESIGN THE GARDEN TO MINIMISE THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE REQUIRED  \nWhen designing your garden, look for ways to keep the maintenance workload manageable for your garden \ngroup. It may be that you start with a small garden and increase the size as more people get involved. Try to use \nlow-maintenance materials in the construction of your garden. For example West Leederville Community Garden \nhas found that their mulched pathways require constant weeding and re-mulching. The garden is considering \nreplacing these with crushed rock paths to reduce the need for ongoing maintenance. \nSTRATEGIES FOR ENSURING PEOPLE MAINTAIN THEIR PLOTS AND COMMUNAL AREAS \nCommunity gardens with allotments (small plots of lands that people pay to garden) sometimes face issues of \nmembers not maintaining their plots and/or not contributing time to maintaining communal areas in the garden \n(e.g. shared garden beds, pathways, worm farming and composting systems, fruit trees and seating areas). Here \nare some strategies you can employ in your garden to deal with these issues: \n Take people through a comprehensive induction process when they join the garden to ensure they \nunderstand their responsibilities in relation to maintenance of their own plot and communal areas. At \nBusselton Community Garden for example, members are responsible for maintaining a weed free plot and \nmust contribute to at least two busy bees at the garden per year. \n \n Hold workshops to provide new members with the skills they need to maintain their plots (for example \nBusselton Community Garden runs a â€˜prepare and revitalise your vegetable plotâ€™ workshop). \n \n    \n \nPage15 \n Publicise agreed procedures for dealing with members who arenâ€™t fulfilling their membership \nresponsibilities and make sure you follow-through and implement these procedures when appropriate. At \nBusselton Community Garden for example, if a member has neglected their plot for one month they receive \na phone call from the committee and then have two weeks to attend to their plot. If no action is taken the \nmember risks forfeiting their plot. \n \n Host weekly gardening days or regular busy bees when people can work together to undertake \nmaintenance of communal areas. \n \n Invite people to nominate to be responsible for specific maintenance tasks in the garden (e.g. turning the \ncompost or feeding the chickens).   \n \n \n \nAnimal roster at Perth City Farm \n \n8. PATIENCE â€“ IT WONâ€™T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT \nA number of elements need to come together in order to grow a successful community garden. Even before the \nfirst hole is dug or seed planted, there are people to be engaged in the process, an appropriate site to be \nsecured, a shared vision to be developed, a garden design to be drawn up and funding and other resources to be \nobtained. All of these tasks take time, especially when undertaken by volunteers who are fitting them in around \npaid work as well as family and other commitments. It commonly takes a year or more from the time of the first \ndiscussions about developing a new garden to work beginning onsite to construct the garden. For some gardens, \nthe start-up phase takes a lot longer. Itâ€™s likely that you will need to be patient in relation to the pace of the \ndevelopment of your community garden. Remember youâ€™re not just building a garden, youâ€™re building \ncommunity and that wonâ€™t happen overnight. In the same way that investing time in building up the nutrients in \nyour garden soil will pay dividends in the long run in terms of a bountiful harvest of fresh vegetables, the time \nyour garden group spends doing things well â€“ building strong relationships, undertaking careful planning, \nnegotiating effective partnerships, raising funds and so on â€“ will reward you with a strong foundation for a \nsuccessful community garden. \n    \n \nPage16 \n9. PLEASURE â€“ IT NEEDS TO BE FUN! \nDigging holes, shifting sleepers, managing group dynamics, responding to concerns of neighbours â€“ setting up \nand maintaining a community garden can feel like hard work at times. Make sure you are always on the lookout \nfor ways to enjoy the journey! Celebrating both the small wins and the big achievements in the development of \nyour garden will help to maintain enthusiasm and energy amongst people involved. See the Physical \nMaintenance section for tips on minimising the burden of ongoing maintenance tasks and for ensuring the \nworkload is shared amongst garden members. Why have a meeting when you can have a party? Sharing food \nand drink when you get together to plan and discuss garden developments is a simple yet effective way of \nmaking meetings more enjoyable. And most importantly, make sure you set aside plenty of time for simply \nrelaxing in the garden â€“ smelling the orange blossom, feeling the breeze on your face, watching the chickens â€“ \nand for admiring the wonderful community asset that you are helping to create.  \nREFERENCES \nFrank, F. and Smith, A.

On one end of the scale, regular dental visits will clear the patient of any potential oral cancers which are highly curable if caught early on. On a lesser scale but perhaps far more prevalent is gum disease, which is an infection of the gum tissue and the bone. This is also true of cavities and broken fillings which, if left untreated can result in root canals, gum surgery and removal of teeth.\nOn a superficial level, regular checkups prevent the build up of plaque and clean the teeth and gums to a healthy level, thereby reducing the onset of bad breath.  Statistics show that 85 percent of people with persistent bad breath can attribute it to a dental problem and low dental surgery attendance.\nSo how regularly should you go for these checkups at your local dental surgery? Well a good rule of thumb is once every six months providing that you have not experience any sensitivity, pain or discomfort anywhere around your jaw line of teeth.\nHowever there are certain conditions that require most frequent visit to the dentists including periodontal and gum disease, poor oral hygiene habits, high use of tobacco and alcohol, pregnancy, diabetes and certain medical conditions. These conditions leave the patient with a higher risk of gum disease, oral cancer and cavities so should visit their dentist on a more regular basis.\nSERVICES\nComprehensive Oral Examinations\nOral Hygiene \u0026 Prophylaxis\nTooth Coloured Restorations\nCEREC Restorations\nCrown \u0026 Bridge Work\nDental Implants\nImplant Supported Dentures\nComplete Removable Dentures\nPartial Removable Dentures\nInvisalign (Clear Braces)\nRoot Canal Treatments\nProfessional Teeth Whitening\nPorcelein Veneers\nExtractions\nPaediatric Dental Procedures\nCoolangatta Practice\n3/100 Griffith St, Coolangatta QLD 4225\nPhone:  (07) 5599 1799\nRunaway Bay Practice\nSuite 4,Oxley Cirle\nShopping centre,\nCnr Lae Drv \u0026 Oxley Drv, Runaway Bay, QLD 4216\nPhone:  (07) 5537 9182\nBallina Practice\n5/31, Cherry street, Ballina, NSW- 2478.\nPhone: (02) 6686 4503\nMurwillumbah Practice\n144 Main Street, Murwillumbah,New South Wales- 2484\nPhone: (02) 6672 1068\nInala Plaza Dental Clinic\n42/156, Inala Avenue,\nInala QLD,4077.\nPhone: (07) 38796966\n",

    "title": "Top 5 Signs of Stress",
    "text": "Â \nÂ \nTop 5 Signs of Stress\nThere are many symptoms that can signal stress. Five of the most common and frequent signs of stress include:\nâ€¢Â Frequent headaches/ migraines/ tension headaches\nâ€¢Â Depressed\nâ€¢Â Anxious\nâ€¢Â Sleep Deprived\nâ€¢Â Weight fluctuation\nIn our fast-paced society, many people see stress as a normal part of life. AlthoughÂ society hasÂ learned to tolerate increased pressure, the affect stress has on the human body, is not something that should be ignored.\nEven though these symptoms may seem common and a part of everyday life for some, these symptoms can lead to more serious health problems and affect your long-term lifestyle and wellbeing.\nWhile most stress comes from events happening at work or at home, rather than dangerous situations, this type of intensity is unnecessary. However, the human body does not know this and consequently, stress takes a major toll on our body.\nStress causes many other health problems such as lowered immune system leading to frequent colds or flu, hypertension, adrenal overload, stomach pains, headaches and varicose veins.\nProlonged Stress is known to impact cardiovascular health and contributed to the progression of autoimmune deficiency diseases. Stress does not cause just physical distress, it can be mentally debilitating as well. Mental and emotional issues triggered by stress include depression, poor concentration, panic attacks, anger issues and reduced analytical skills.\nÂ \nRecognize Signs of Stress\nAs an employer, it is critical to recognize work-related stress as a significant health and safety issue. The ability to evaluate workloads, resolve personality conflicts and deal with stress, is an important part of curtailing these problems before they affect your business and personal life.\nOn average, six working days per year per employee are lost due to factors such as absenteeism. These issues see the productivity level and achievements of a company significantly decrease and reduce business turnover as many stress related illnesses associated with these factors, see businesses paying full price for employees only offering half the effort.\nÂ \nAct for a Solution\nAt first glance, depression simply causes low energy and feelings of low self worth but ultimately, it affects everything from sleeping patterns to work productivity to personal lives. If not treated, depression can lead to serious consequences such as a breakdown of families or suicidal tendencies.\nÂ \nCorporate Clarity is here to assist in the management of stress and ultimately change how the mind and body initially react to stress.\nÂ \nMake a change for the future today...\nÂ \nÂ \nWebsite design by Concept Marketing\nCopyright Â© 2010 Corporate Clarity\nÂ \n",

Whether it is finding a new job, a place to live, packing or making new friends a total upheaval is not always the most pleasant experience. It can be less stressful by looking into Sydney removalists. Movers make changing homes a great experience. Using removalists means a lot of the work that normally goes into moving does not have to be done.\nRemovalists will come to your home pack and move your belongings to their new home. Most companies will let you choose just how involved in the moving process the movers are. If you want to pack your delicates, it will not be a problem. They can pack everything for you or just move the boxes that you have packed. A list is kept of all the large furnishings and boxes which makes it easier to ensure that all of your possessions made it to your new home.\nRemovalists Sydney also keeps the heavy lifting to a minimum. There is no need to strain your back or wear yourself to a frazzle when moving. Let a mover take care of the big furniture and boxes of heavy books. The company should mark each box so that the boxes will be staged in the appropriate room. Unpacking does not get any easier.\nThe removalists will take your belongings from your old home to the new one. Instead of moving, you can get straight into unpacking and decorating. You can put that extra energy that you conserved to use by finding that great new job or meeting all of your new neighbors.\nRead the rest of this entry\nComments Off\nFiled under: Moving\nAbout this blog\nFind out more about people, traditions, lifestyle and habits.\nRecent Posts\nLuxury Meets Affordability with Value Point Distribution\nWhat makes a good tyre\nCulture Of Poland\nPolish Australian\nSt. Adalbert â€“ Poland\nMust read\nWhy Poly Rain Water Tanks are Better than Other Water Tanks\nCategories\nAustralia\nAutomotive\nFashion\nHome\nMoving\nPoland\nTags\nAustralia Australians Bison Grass Vodka Fashion good tyre hard water job material Moving New Town oven place to live Poland Possum Possum Removal repairs stove Sydney Tempe tyres vodka water water softener Water Tanks\n",

Thermage will make you look younger with better contoured, smoother skin and softened lines and wrinkles. It can be used on most areas of the body, including the face (wrinkles, jowls, turkey neck, baggy eyes and undefined lips), stomach, arms, hands, thighs, buttocks. As it tightens the skin, it also temporarily reduces the appearance of cellulite.\nWhat is involved in a Thermage treatment?\nThe radio frequency energy heats the deeper dermis layer of the skin, whilst protecting and cooling the epidermis (outer layer of skin), stimulating the growth of new collagen. During the procedure, the surface of the skin is kept cool.\nThe treatment takes around one to two hours and does not result in any down time. Some results are noticeable immediately, and some after about six months when new collagen is produced.\nIs Thermage safe?\nYes, Thermage is completely safe in the hands of expert practitioners. As the heat is delivered into the skin, a cooling system keeps the surface of your skin cool and unharmed.\nIs there any downtime after a Thermage treatment?\nNone whatsoever. You can go straight back to work or other activities following your procedure.\nWhat are the results of Thermage and how long will they last?\nThe results appear over the following two to six months as the new collagen growth tightens the underlying skin, improving the visible contours and texture. Unlike many other treatments, only one session is needed to achieve results. As the process stimulates collagen growth, your new appearance can last years, depending on your age and level of skin laxity.\nPrinciple Doctor:\nDr Garry Cussell\nSYDNEY CBD\nCONTACT US\nAddress:\n263 George St, Sydney\nPhone:\n1300 88 99 35\nEmail:\ninfo@facialrejuvenation.com.au\nWeb:\nwww.facialrejuvenation.com.au\nTESTIMONIAL\nThis is the first testimonial ...\nPatient 1\nThis is the second testimonial\nPatient 2\nread more\u003e\u003e\nTREATMENT Q \u0026 A HEADER\nTo read some of the most frequently asked questions that patients ask Dr Cussell about Thermage and Tighter Skin, please click on the \"read more\" link below.\nread more\u003e\u003e\nCONTACT US\nName\nEmail\nHome\nPrivacy Policy\nRefunds \u0026 Returns\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdelaide\nBrisbane\nCanberra\nGold Coast\nMelbourne\nPerth\nSydney\nBody Contouring\nBreast Surgery\nLipo\nSkin Care Products\nSmoother Skin\nTattoo Removal\nTighter Skin\nWrinkle Injections\nMove\nClose\nTestimonials for Clinic Name\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nMove\nClose\nTestimonials for Clinic Name\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nTestimonial goes here\n-- Patient name goes here\nMove\nClose\nQuestions and Answers for ------\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nMove\nClose\nQuestions and Answers for ------\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\nQuestion goes here\nAnswer goes here\n",
